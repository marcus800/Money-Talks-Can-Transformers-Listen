0,Good afternoon.,CHAIR POWELL.
1,"At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us:  maximum employment and price stability.",CHAIR POWELL.
2,"Today, in support of these goals, the Federal Open Market Committee kept its policy interest rate near zero and stated its expectation that an increase in this rate would soon be appropriate.",CHAIR POWELL.
3,The Committee also agreed to continue reducing its net asset purchases on the schedule we announced in December—bringing them to an end in early March.,CHAIR POWELL.
4,"As I will explain, against a backdrop of elevated inflation and a strong labor market, our policy has been adapting to the evolving economic environment, and it will continue to do so.",CHAIR POWELL.
5,"Economic activity expanded at a robust pace last year, reflecting progress on vaccinations and the reopening of the economy, fiscal and monetary policy support, and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses.",CHAIR POWELL.
6,"Indeed, the economy has shown great strength and resilience in the face of the ongoing pandemic.",CHAIR POWELL.
7,The recent sharp rise in COVID cases associated with the Omicron variant will surely weigh on economic growth this quarter.,CHAIR POWELL.
8,"High-frequency indicators point to reduced spending in COVID-sensitive sectors, such as travel and restaurants.",CHAIR POWELL.
9,"And activity more broadly may also be affected as many workers are unable to report for work because of illness, quarantines, or caregiving needs.",CHAIR POWELL.
10,"Fortunately, health experts are finding that the Omicron variant has not been as virulent as previous strains of the virus, and they expect that cases will drop off rapidly.",CHAIR POWELL.
11,"If the wave passes quickly, the economic effects should as well, and we would see a return to strong growth.",CHAIR POWELL.
12,"That said, the implications for the economy remain uncertain.",CHAIR POWELL.
13,"And we have not lost sight of the lines, the virus continues to cause great hardship.",CHAIR POWELL.
14,"The labor market has made remarkable progress and, by many measures, is very strong.",CHAIR POWELL.
15,"Job gains have been solid in recent months, averaging 365,000 per month over the past three months.",CHAIR POWELL.
16,"Over the past year, payroll employment has risen by 6.4 million jobs.",CHAIR POWELL.
17,"The unemployment rate has declined sharply, falling 2 percentage points over the past six months to reach 3.9 percent in December.",CHAIR POWELL.
18,"The improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution, as well as for African Americans and Hispanics.",CHAIR POWELL.
19,Labor demand remains historically strong.,CHAIR POWELL.
20,"With constraints on labor supply, employers are having difficulties filling job openings, and wages are rising at their fastest pace in many years.",CHAIR POWELL.
21,"While labor force participation has edged up, it remains subdued, in part reflecting the aging of the population and retirements.",CHAIR POWELL.
22,"In addition, some who would otherwise would be seeking work report that they are out of the labor force because of factors related to the pandemic, including caregiving needs and ongoing concerns about the virus.",CHAIR POWELL.
23,The current wave of the virus may well prolong these effects.,CHAIR POWELL.
24,"Over time, there are good reasons to expect some further improvements in participation and employment.",CHAIR POWELL.
25,Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.,CHAIR POWELL.
26,Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and [to] the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation.,CHAIR POWELL.
27,"In particular, bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond to higher demand in the near term.",CHAIR POWELL.
28,"These problems have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, exacerbated by waves of the virus.",CHAIR POWELL.
29,"dislocations caused by the pandemic, price increases have now spread to a broader range of goods and services.",CHAIR POWELL.
30,"Wages have also risen briskly, and we are attentive to the risks that persistent real wage growth in excess of productivity [growth] could put upward pressure on inflation.",CHAIR POWELL.
31,"Like most forecasters, we continue to expect inflation to decline over the course of the year.",CHAIR POWELL.
32,"We understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.",CHAIR POWELL.
33,"In addition, we believe that the best thing we can do to support continued labor market gains is to promote a long expansion, and that will require price stability.",CHAIR POWELL.
34,We are committed to our price-stability goal.,CHAIR POWELL.
35,We will use our tools both to support the economy and a strong labor market and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched.,CHAIR POWELL.
36,And we’ll be watching carefully to see whether the economy is evolving in line with expectations.,CHAIR POWELL.
37,The Fed’s monetary policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.,CHAIR POWELL.
38,"As I noted, the Committee left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged and reaffirmed our plan, announced in December, to end asset purchases in early March.",CHAIR POWELL.
39,"In light of the remarkable progress we’ve seen in the labor market and inflation that is well above our 2 percent longer-run goal, the economy no longer needs sustained high levels of monetary policy support.",CHAIR POWELL.
40,That is why we are phasing out our asset purchases and why we expect it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate.,CHAIR POWELL.
41,"Of course, the economic outlook remains highly uncertain.",CHAIR POWELL.
42,"Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires humility, recognizing that the economy evolves in outcomes.",CHAIR POWELL.
43,"With this in mind, we will remain attentive to risks, including the risk that high inflation is more persistent than expected, and are prepared to respond as appropriate to achieve our goals.",CHAIR POWELL.
44,"To provide greater clarity about our approach for reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, today the Committee issued a set of principles that will provide a foundation for our future decisions.",CHAIR POWELL.
45,"[In] these high-level principles, [we] clarify that the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting monetary policy and that reducing our balance sheet will occur after the process of raising interest rates has begun.",CHAIR POWELL.
46,Reductions will occur over time in a predictable manner primarily through adjustments to reinvestments so that securities roll off our balance sheet.,CHAIR POWELL.
47,"Over time, we intend to hold securities in the amounts needed for our ample-reserves operating framework, and in the longer run, we envision holding primarily Treasury securities.",CHAIR POWELL.
48,Our decisions to reduce our balance sheet will be guided by our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.,CHAIR POWELL.
49,"In that regard, we will be prepared to adjust any of the details of our approach to balance sheet management in light of economic and financial developments.",CHAIR POWELL.
50,"The Committee has not made decisions regarding the specific timing, pace, or other details of shrinking the balance sheet.",CHAIR POWELL.
51,And we will discuss these matters in upcoming meetings and provide additional information at the appropriate time.,CHAIR POWELL.
52,"To conclude:  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.",CHAIR POWELL.
53,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.,CHAIR POWELL.
54,We at the Federal Reserve will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.,CHAIR POWELL.
55,Thank you.,CHAIR POWELL.
56,I look forward to your questions.,CHAIR POWELL.
57,Associated Press.,CHAIR POWELL.
58,"Thanks, Michelle.",CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
59,"And thank you, Chair Powell.",CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
60,"So it’s expected that the Fed will hike rates perhaps every other meeting, but certainly in the past, the Fed has hiked at every meeting.",CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
61,"So I just wanted to ask, you know, are rate hikes at consecutive meetings on the table this year?",CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
62,Is every meeting a live—a live meeting?,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
63,"And, on that note, would the Fed consider front-loading some of its rate hikes, even if it doesn’t raise at every meeting?",CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
64,Thank you.,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
65,Thanks.,CHAIR POWELL.
66,"So, as I—as I referred to in my opening statement, it’s—it is not possible to predict with much confidence exactly what path for our policy rate is going to prove appropriate.",CHAIR POWELL.
67,"And so, at this time, we haven’t made any decisions about the path of policy.",CHAIR POWELL.
68,And I stress again that we’ll be humble and nimble.,CHAIR POWELL.
69,We’re going to have to navigate crosscurrents and actually two-sided risks now.,CHAIR POWELL.
70,"So—and, and I’ll say also that we’re going to be guided by the data.",CHAIR POWELL.
71,"In fact, what I’ll say is that we’re going to be led by the incoming data and the evolving outlook, which we’ll try to communicate as clearly as possible, moving steadily and transparency—transparently.",CHAIR POWELL.
72,"So more to your question, we know that the economy is in a very different place than it was when we began raising rates in 2015.",CHAIR POWELL.
73,"Specifically, the economy is now much stronger.",CHAIR POWELL.
74,The labor market is far stronger.,CHAIR POWELL.
75,"Inflation is running well above our 2 percent target, much higher than it was at that time.",CHAIR POWELL.
76,And these differences are likely to have important implications for the appropriate pace of policy adjustments.,CHAIR POWELL.
77,"Beyond that, we haven’t made any decisions.",CHAIR POWELL.
78,Thank you.,MICHELLE SMITH.
79,Let’s go to Victoria Guida at Politico.,MICHELLE SMITH.
80,health of the labor market.,MICHELLE SMITH.
81,And I’m curious whether you would characterize where we’re at right now as maximum employment.,MICHELLE SMITH.
82,"And also, along those same lines, obviously rate hikes [are] on the table this year, do you think that the Fed can raise rates, bring inflation under control without hurting jobs and wages?",MICHELLE SMITH.
83,Sorry.,CHAIR POWELL.
84,"Just getting both, both parts of your question written down.",CHAIR POWELL.
85,So I would say—and this view is widely held on the Committee—that both sides of the mandate are calling for us to move steadily away from the very highly accommodative policies we put in place during the challenging economic conditions that the economy faced earlier in the pandemic.,CHAIR POWELL.
86,And I would say that most FOMC participants agree that labor market conditions are consistent with maximum employment in the sense of the highest level of employment that is consistent with price stability.,CHAIR POWELL.
87,And that is—that is my personal view.,CHAIR POWELL.
88,"And, and, again, very broad support on the Committee for the judgment that it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate.",CHAIR POWELL.
89,"The other thing is, maximum employment will, will evolve over time and through the course of the business cycle.",CHAIR POWELL.
90,"In the particular situation we’re in now, it may well increase.",CHAIR POWELL.
91,Max—the level of maximum—of employment that’s consistent with stable prices may increase.,CHAIR POWELL.
92,"And we hope that it will, as more people come back into the labor market, as participation gradually rises.",CHAIR POWELL.
93,And the policy path that we’re broadly contemplating would be supportive of that comment—that outcome as well.,CHAIR POWELL.
94,"So the thing about the labor market right now is that there are—there are many millions of, of more job openings than there are unemployed people.",CHAIR POWELL.
95,"So you ask whether we can—whether we can raise rates and, and move to less accommodative, and even tight, financial rates without threatening the labor market.",CHAIR POWELL.
96,"This is, by so many measures, a historically tight labor market.",CHAIR POWELL.
97,"Record levels of job openings, of quits.",CHAIR POWELL.
98,Wages are moving up at the highest pace they have in decades.,CHAIR POWELL.
99,"If you look at surveys of workers, they find jobs plentiful.",CHAIR POWELL.
100,Look at surveys of companies—they find workers scarce.,CHAIR POWELL.
101,"And all of those readings are at levels, really, that we haven’t seen in a long time—and, in some cases, ever.",CHAIR POWELL.
102,"So this is a very, very strong labor market, and my strong sense is that we can—we can—we can move rates up without, without having to, you know, severely undermine it.",CHAIR POWELL.
103,"I also would point out that there are—there are other forces at work this year, which should also help bring down inflation, we hope, including improvement on the supply side, which will ultimately come.",CHAIR POWELL.
104,The timing and pace of that are uncertain.,CHAIR POWELL.
105,"And also, fiscal policy is going to be less supportive of, of growth this year—not of the level of economic activity, but the fiscal impulse to growth will be significantly lower.",CHAIR POWELL.
106,So there are multiple forces—which should be working over the course of the year for inflation to come down.,CHAIR POWELL.
107,"We do realize that the timing and pace of that are, are highly uncertain and that inflation has persisted longer than we—than we thought.",CHAIR POWELL.
108,"And, of course, we’re prepared to use our tools to assure that higher inflation does not become entrenched.",CHAIR POWELL.
109,Thank you.,MICHELLE SMITH.
110,Let’s go to Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal.,MICHELLE SMITH.
111,"Good afternoon, Chair Powell.",NICK TIMIRAOS.
112,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.,NICK TIMIRAOS.
113,"I, I have a couple of questions on the balance sheet.",NICK TIMIRAOS.
114,The statement on the balance sheet today calls for “significantly reducing” your holdings.,NICK TIMIRAOS.
115,What does that mean?,NICK TIMIRAOS.
116,"And then, apart from moving sooner and faster to shrink the holdings, are there any other ways in which you and your colleagues are seriously thinking about recalibrating this process?",NICK TIMIRAOS.
117,"And, finally, how much passive sales or changes in the composition of reinvestments?",NICK TIMIRAOS.
118,Thank you.,NICK TIMIRAOS.
119,"So I’m afraid to tell you that those are all great questions, and they’re questions that the Committee is just turning to now.",CHAIR POWELL.
120,"So we had—we had a discussion, as you know, at the last meeting, an introductory discussion of the balance sheet and a teeing up of the issues.",CHAIR POWELL.
121,"At this meeting, we’ve gone through and carefully put together a set of principles at a high level.",CHAIR POWELL.
122,"And those are meant to guide the actual decisions we’ll make about the pace and about all of the questions that you’re, you’re asking.",CHAIR POWELL.
123,"And I expect that this process will, will be something that we spend time on in coming meetings.",CHAIR POWELL.
124,I can’t tell you how many.,CHAIR POWELL.
125,I can’t tell you how long it will take.,CHAIR POWELL.
126,"But—and then, you know, at the appropriate time, we’ll provide additional information.",CHAIR POWELL.
127,"So I did—the last cycle when we—when we went through balance sheet issues, we did find that over, over the course of two or three meetings, for example, we did come to interesting and better answers, we thought.",CHAIR POWELL.
128,So we’re just in that process now.,CHAIR POWELL.
129,"And at the next meeting, we’ll be turning to, you know, more of the details that you’re—that you’re asking about.",CHAIR POWELL.
130,I would say this.,CHAIR POWELL.
131,"The balance sheet is, is much bigger.",CHAIR POWELL.
132,I’d say it has a shorter duration than the last time.,CHAIR POWELL.
133,"And the economy’s much stronger, and inflation is much higher.",CHAIR POWELL.
134,"So—and I think that leads you to—and I said, I’ve said this—being willing to move sooner than we did the last time and also perhaps faster.",CHAIR POWELL.
135,"But beyond that, it’s really—it’s really not appropriate for me to speculate exactly what that would be.",CHAIR POWELL.
136,"And, and—but I would point you to principle number one, which is “the Committee views changes in the target range for the federal funds rate as its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.”  So we do want the federal funds rate—we, we want to operationalize that [as the primary means].",CHAIR POWELL.
137,And we want the balance sheet reinvestments.,CHAIR POWELL.
138,"So, if I could follow on that, raising rates and reducing the balance sheet both restrain the economy, both tighten monetary policy.",NICK TIMIRAOS.
139,How should we think about the relationship between the two?,NICK TIMIRAOS.
140,"For example, how much passive runoff is equal to every ¼ percentage point increase in your benchmark rate?",NICK TIMIRAOS.
141,"So, again, we think of the balance sheet as, as moving in a predictable manner, sort of in the background, and that the active tool meeting to meeting is not both of them, it’s the federal funds rate.",CHAIR POWELL.
142,"There are—there are rules of thumb—I’m reluctant to land on one of them—that, that equate this.",CHAIR POWELL.
143,"And—but there’s also an element of, of uncertainty around the balance sheet.",CHAIR POWELL.
144,"I think we have a much better sense, frankly, of how rate increases affect financial conditions and, hence, economic conditions.",CHAIR POWELL.
145,"Balance sheet [policy] is, is still a relatively new thing for, for the markets and for us, so we’re less certain about that.",CHAIR POWELL.
146,"So, again, our—I think our—the pattern we’ll follow is to—is to arrive at a, you know, a timing and a pace and composition and all those things and then announce that with advance notice, and, and it will—it will start in the background.",CHAIR POWELL.
147,"And then we’ll look to have that just running in the background and have—and have the interest rates, again, be the active tool of monetary policy.",CHAIR POWELL.
148,"That’s, that’s at least the plan.",CHAIR POWELL.
149,"I can’t tell you much more about any of the—any of the very good issues about size, pace, composition, those sorts of things.",CHAIR POWELL.
150,But we’ll be turning to all of those at coming meetings.,CHAIR POWELL.
151,Thank you.,NICK TIMIRAOS.
152,Thanks.,MICHELLE SMITH.
153,Now we’ll go to Neil Irwin.,MICHELLE SMITH.
154,"Sir, I was wondering if the volatility we’ve seen in financial markets in the last few weeks strikes you as anything alarming or that might affect the trajectory of policy.",MICHELLE SMITH.
155,"Conversely, to the degree that financial conditions have tightened some, might that be desirable in some ways in achieving your, your tightening goals?",MICHELLE SMITH.
156,"So, as you know, the ultimate focus that we have is on the real economy:  maximum employment and price stability.",CHAIR POWELL.
157,And financial conditions matter to the extent that they have implications for achieving the dual mandate.,CHAIR POWELL.
158,"And you also know that we, we look at broader financial conditions, not one or two things, one or two markets.",CHAIR POWELL.
159,"And what we’re always asking ourselves is, are we seeing changes that are both persistent and material enough that—of a change in financial conditions—that they are inconsistent with the achievement of our goals?",CHAIR POWELL.
160,So that’s how we’re looking at that.,CHAIR POWELL.
161,"And I don’t want to comment on today’s financial conditions broadly, but we’re not looking at any one market or, or so.",CHAIR POWELL.
162,So that’s how we’re thinking.,CHAIR POWELL.
163,"In terms of what we’ve seen, I would say this.",CHAIR POWELL.
164,"We, you know, we said at our last meeting we published the Summary of Economic Projections, the median of which—the median participant expected three rate increases this year.",CHAIR POWELL.
165,"And, you know, it’s six weeks, seven weeks later now.",CHAIR POWELL.
166,And you have seen that our communication channel with the markets is working.,CHAIR POWELL.
167,"Markets are, are now pricing in a number of rate increases.",CHAIR POWELL.
168,"Surveys show that market participants are expecting a balance sheet runoff to begin, you know, at the appropriate time, sometime later this year perhaps.",CHAIR POWELL.
169,We haven’t made that decision yet.,CHAIR POWELL.
170,"So we, we feel like the communications we have with market participants and with the general public are working and policy works significantly through expectations.",CHAIR POWELL.
171,"So that, that in and of itself is appropriate.",CHAIR POWELL.
172,Thank you.,MICHELLE SMITH.
173,Let’s go to Howard Schneider.,MICHELLE SMITH.
174,"You know, for a year or so—Hi.",HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
175,"Thanks, Chair Powell.",HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
176,Howard Schneider with Reuters.,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
177,"So for a year now, the statements referenced the benchmarks for this initial interest rate increase.",HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
178,"Now that we’re approaching that moment, what are the benchmarks going to be for subsequent rate increases?",HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
179,"I know you can’t stipulate the path, but how should we think about the criteria for the next step and the next step?",HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
180,"Well, you’re right.",CHAIR POWELL.
181,We haven’t got—we haven’t gotten to that point yet.,CHAIR POWELL.
182,"We haven’t made a decision yet, and we’ll make that decision at the March meeting.",CHAIR POWELL.
183,We’ll make a decision whether to raise the federal funds rate.,CHAIR POWELL.
184,"I would say that the Committee is, is of a mind to, to raise the federal funds rate at the March meeting, assuming that conditions are appropriate for doing so.",CHAIR POWELL.
185,"We have—we have our eyes on, on the risks, particularly around the world.",CHAIR POWELL.
186,"But we do expect some softening in the economy from Omicron, but we think that that should be temporary.",CHAIR POWELL.
187,"And we think that the economy should—the underlying strength of the economy should, you know, should, should—show through fairly quickly after that.",CHAIR POWELL.
188,"If I could follow just on a related question, the December SEPs had this copacetic sort of set of circumstances where inflation comes down without the federal funds rate ever getting over the estimate of neutral.",HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
189,"Given developments since then, do you still think that’s a credible narrative for the ultimate path of policy?",HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
190,"I think the path is highly uncertain and that we’re committed to using our tools to make sure that inflation, high inflation that we’re seeing, does not become entrenched.",CHAIR POWELL.
191,So a number of factors would be—it’s not just monetary policy—a number of significantly less of an impulse to growth.,CHAIR POWELL.
192,"We do expect this year—although we do expect now that it will come slower than, than we had expected and hoped—that there will be relief on the supply side.",CHAIR POWELL.
193,"So that, too, should—should lower the supply-side barriers, which are a big part of the story of why inflation is high.",CHAIR POWELL.
194,"In addition, monetary policy will be becoming significantly less accommodative.",CHAIR POWELL.
195,"So the question is—you know, we’ll, we’ll be asking this question all year long, and that will be, are things turning out as we expect?",CHAIR POWELL.
196,"There’s a case that, for whatever reason, the economy slows more and inflation slows more than expected; we’ll react to that.",CHAIR POWELL.
197,"If, instead, we see inflation at a higher level or a more persistent level, then we’ll react to that.",CHAIR POWELL.
198,"And, again, we’re, we’re well aware that this is a different economy than—than existed during the last tightening cycle, and our policy is going to reflect those differences.",CHAIR POWELL.
199,Thank you.,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
200,Thank you.,MICHELLE SMITH.
201,Let’s go to Jeanna Smialek.,MICHELLE SMITH.
202,Let’s go to Jeanna.,MICHELLE SMITH.
203,[No response]  Okay.,MICHELLE SMITH.
204,Let’s go to Steve Liesman.,MICHELLE SMITH.
205,"Thank you, Michelle.",STEVE LIESMAN.
206,"And thank you, Mr. Chairman.",STEVE LIESMAN.
207,"Mr. Chairman, I have one sort of technical question and one question on principle.",STEVE LIESMAN.
208,"The technical question is, if, if you’re going to discuss balance sheet at the next upcoming meetings and you won’t begin balance sheet reduction until after you begin rate hikes, it seems to technically mean that you won’t or can’t begin balance sheet reduction until the summer.",STEVE LIESMAN.
209,Is that correct?,STEVE LIESMAN.
210,That’s the first thing.,STEVE LIESMAN.
211,"Second of all, you suggested that, that the—with balance sheet running in the background—that you would possibly be raising rates and running off the balance sheet at the said it’s going to be running in the background.",STEVE LIESMAN.
212,"But the statement on the balance sheet principles says “the Committee is prepared to adjust any of the details of its approach” based on “economic and financial developments,” which suggests there’s something of a reaction function associated to the balance sheet and it won’t be running in the background.",STEVE LIESMAN.
213,So can you give us any sense of the discussion or staff presentation on what is the reaction function surrounding the balance sheet?,STEVE LIESMAN.
214,Thanks.,STEVE LIESMAN.
215,So let me—let me—let me start by talking about that last paragraph.,CHAIR POWELL.
216,"So you’ll remember during the last cycle that this process of building up and then shrinking the balance sheet is a complicated one, and it involves, inevitably, surprises.",CHAIR POWELL.
217,"And so during, during the years, during the prior cycle, we amended our balance sheet principles a number of times.",CHAIR POWELL.
218,"Now, we didn’t intend to do that.",CHAIR POWELL.
219,It just—events required us to do so.,CHAIR POWELL.
220,So we got a pretty robust paragraph there that says we’re free to do this at any time.,CHAIR POWELL.
221,"And it doesn’t mean we’re going to, but if the situation turns out to be different than we had thought, we’re not going to be—we’re not going to stick with something that isn’t working.",CHAIR POWELL.
222,That’s all that’s saying.,CHAIR POWELL.
223,"It’s meant to be quite a general statement rather than a, a hint.",CHAIR POWELL.
224,"So, I mean, I like to think that our, you know, our philosophy of the balance sheet is, is embodied in these principles.",CHAIR POWELL.
225,"So, you know, the idea that, for example, the federal funds rate is the primary means of adjusting the stance of policy, that we’ll use—determine the timing and pace of reducing the size of the balance sheet to foster the dual mandate, that we’ll begin to reduce the size after we begin the process of raising rates, and on and on like that.",CHAIR POWELL.
226,"I mean, that—those are all the things that, that try to describe how we will proceed.",CHAIR POWELL.
227,"were, were enormously important at the beginning of the recovery in terms of restoring market function, as they were at—right after the—in the critical phase of the Global Financial Crisis.",CHAIR POWELL.
228,"And then after [that], they were a macroeconomic tool to support demand.",CHAIR POWELL.
229,"And now the economy no longer needs this, this highly accommodative policy that we put in place.",CHAIR POWELL.
230,"So it’s time to stop asset purchases first and then, at the appropriate time, start to shrink the balance sheet.",CHAIR POWELL.
231,"Now, the balance sheet is, is substantially larger than it needs to be.",CHAIR POWELL.
232,We’ve identified the end state as—in amounts needed to implement monetary policy efficiently [and] effectively in the ample-reserves regime.,CHAIR POWELL.
233,"So there’s a substantial amount of, of shrinkage in the balance sheet to be done.",CHAIR POWELL.
234,That’s going to take some time.,CHAIR POWELL.
235,We want that process to be orderly and predictable.,CHAIR POWELL.
236,"And so those are some of the ways that I would think this, this lays out our, you know, the way we—the way we’re thinking about this.",CHAIR POWELL.
237,"In terms of the timing, I can’t really help you.",CHAIR POWELL.
238,"You know, it just says after, after we get under way.",CHAIR POWELL.
239,"So we’re—I would say we are, we’re going to have another discussion at, at the next meeting.",CHAIR POWELL.
240,"And my guess is, we’ll have at least one other discussion at the meeting after that.",CHAIR POWELL.
241,"And, you know, we’ll, we’ll tell you as we make progress.",CHAIR POWELL.
242,"And we’ll, you know, we’ll start the process of allowing runoff and shrinking the balance sheet at what we find to be the appropriate time.",CHAIR POWELL.
243,It’s—I wish I could say more.,CHAIR POWELL.
244,"But, honestly, we haven’t made those decisions.",CHAIR POWELL.
245,"And we actually haven’t even really had the, the important discussions on a lot of the details that we will have at coming meetings.",CHAIR POWELL.
246,Thank you.,MICHELLE SMITH.
247,Let’s go to Craig Torres.,MICHELLE SMITH.
248,"Chair Powell, Chair Powell.",CRAIG TORRES.
249,"Good afternoon, Michelle and Chair Powell.",CRAIG TORRES.
250,Craig Torres from Bloomberg.,CRAIG TORRES.
251,"Chair Powell, at the beginning of the conversation, you elusive soft landing.",CRAIG TORRES.
252,Is Fed policy a risk?,CRAIG TORRES.
253,Overtightening?,CRAIG TORRES.
254,Or what are the risks?,CRAIG TORRES.
255,"And then second, Chair Powell, I have a quick administrative question.",CRAIG TORRES.
256,"You know, Robert Kaplan’s disclosure of his securities transactions—and in a couple of months, Chair Powell, or maybe sooner, you and I will file our tax returns.",CRAIG TORRES.
257,And we’ll list transactions and all kinds of things.,CRAIG TORRES.
258,"And next to those transactions, we’ll put dates.",CRAIG TORRES.
259,And Bloomberg asked for the dates of Mr. Kaplan’s transactions.,CRAIG TORRES.
260,The Dallas Fed is not giving us the dates.,CRAIG TORRES.
261,And I don’t see why this is a matter for the inspector general or anybody else.,CRAIG TORRES.
262,"I mean, why can’t he give us the dates?",CRAIG TORRES.
263,Will you help us get the dates of those transactions?,CRAIG TORRES.
264,Thanks.,CRAIG TORRES.
265,So you asked about the risks first.,CHAIR POWELL.
266,"So I—you know, the one risk is that inflation risks are still to the upside in the views of most FOMC participants and, certainly, in my view as well.",CHAIR POWELL.
267,"There’s a risk that, that the high inflation we’re seeing will be prolonged, and there’s a risk that it will move even higher.",CHAIR POWELL.
268,"So we don’t—we don’t think that’s the base case, but you asked what the risks are.",CHAIR POWELL.
269,And that’s—we have to be in a position with our monetary policy to address all of the plausible outcomes.,CHAIR POWELL.
270,And that calls for us to be in position.,CHAIR POWELL.
271,"We, we have an expectation about the way the economy is going to be evolved, but we’ve got to be in a position to, to address different outcomes, including the one where inflation remains higher.",CHAIR POWELL.
272,"And, of course, that is a risk to the—to the—to the expansion.",CHAIR POWELL.
273,"You know, we’ve been saying that what we need here is another long expansion, which is the kind of thing we saw over the last [one], which was a record long expansion.",CHAIR POWELL.
274,We saw labor force participation rise.,CHAIR POWELL.
275,"We saw wages persistently higher for people at the lower end, and there, there really was no obvious not hit by the pandemic.",CHAIR POWELL.
276,So we’d love to find a way to get back to that.,CHAIR POWELL.
277,"That’s going to require price stability, and that’s going to require the Fed to tighten interest rate policy and do our part in getting inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.",CHAIR POWELL.
278,So I mentioned two-sided risks.,CHAIR POWELL.
279,"You know, a couple things.",CHAIR POWELL.
280,"One, Omi—COVID is not over.",CHAIR POWELL.
281,"And COVID can continue to evolve, and it’s just—we have to accept that it’s not over, and the risks to it can slow down growth.",CHAIR POWELL.
282,And that would be—that’s sort of a downside risk from a growth standpoint.,CHAIR POWELL.
283,"I would point to—you know, another, another risk is just further, further problems in the supply chains, which could slow down activity.",CHAIR POWELL.
284,"And you see the situation in China as a situation there where that’s—their no-COVID policy may cause more lockdowns, is likely to, and that may play into—may play into more problems in supply chains.",CHAIR POWELL.
285,"In addition, there’s what’s going on in Eastern Europe and things like that.",CHAIR POWELL.
286,So there’s plenty of risk out there.,CHAIR POWELL.
287,"And we, you know, we can’t—we can’t forget that there are risks on both sides.",CHAIR POWELL.
288,"So that’s, that’s there.",CHAIR POWELL.
289,That’s what I would say.,CHAIR POWELL.
290,"I know you’ve been all over this issue with, with my colleagues, Craig, on the issue of, of information.",CHAIR POWELL.
291,We don’t—we don’t have that information at the Board.,CHAIR POWELL.
292,"And, you know, I hand—I asked the inspector general to do an investigation, and that is out of my hands.",CHAIR POWELL.
293,I play no role in it.,CHAIR POWELL.
294,I seek to play no role in it.,CHAIR POWELL.
295,And I don’t—I really—I can’t help you here today on this issue.,CHAIR POWELL.
296,And I’m sorry I can’t.,CHAIR POWELL.
297,"Okay, okay.",CRAIG TORRES.
298,Thank you.,MICHELLE SMITH.
299,We’ll go to Jeanna now.,MICHELLE SMITH.
300,tech issues.,MICHELLE SMITH.
301,I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about where your thinking on inflation stands today.,MICHELLE SMITH.
302,"You know, the last time we saw an SEP back in September, we saw that you and your colleagues were projecting that inflation would sort of sink back down quite close to target by the end of the year.",MICHELLE SMITH.
303,And I wonder if you still think that projection from December is a reasonable one.,MICHELLE SMITH.
304,"And if your thinking has changed at all, I wonder how you’re thinking about that.",MICHELLE SMITH.
305,And I also wonder if you could talk a little bit about the pathway to getting to that deceleration.,MICHELLE SMITH.
306,"Like, how do—how do we get from here, 7 percent CPI, to where you expect to be at the end of the year?",MICHELLE SMITH.
307,"So I’d say, you know, since, since the December meeting, I would say that the inflation situation is about the same but probably slightly worse.",CHAIR POWELL.
308,I’d be inclined to raise my own estimate of 2022 core PCE inflation—let’s just go with that—by a few tenths today.,CHAIR POWELL.
309,"But we’re not writing, writing down an SEP at this meeting.",CHAIR POWELL.
310,But I think it’s—it hasn’t gotten better.,CHAIR POWELL.
311,"It’s probably gotten just a—just a bit worse, and that’s been the pattern.",CHAIR POWELL.
312,That’s been the pattern.,CHAIR POWELL.
313,So I think if you look at the—the FOMC participants are—there’s a range there.,CHAIR POWELL.
314,"And that range has been moving to the right for, for a year now.",CHAIR POWELL.
315,"And, by the way, if you look at other forecasters, essentially all other macro forecasters who do this for a living, you’ve seen the same pattern.",CHAIR POWELL.
316,"So, what do we think about that?",CHAIR POWELL.
317,"Well, I think we, you know, we wrote down rate increases in the December meetings, each of us individually.",CHAIR POWELL.
318,"And I think to the extent the situation deteriorates further, our policy will have to address that, if it deteriorates meaningfully further, either in the time dimension or in the size of the inflation dimension.",CHAIR POWELL.
319,So that’s how we’re thinking about it.,CHAIR POWELL.
320,"from a very highly accommodative policy to a substantially less accommodative policy and then, over time, to a policy that’s not accommodative, in time.",CHAIR POWELL.
321,I don’t know when that will be.,CHAIR POWELL.
322,That’s—those are the things that we’re—that we’re thinking about.,CHAIR POWELL.
323,"That’s, that’s part of it.",CHAIR POWELL.
324,Another part of it is that fiscal policy provided an impulse to growth over the last two years.,CHAIR POWELL.
325,"That impulse will be less, in fact, will be—will be negative this year.",CHAIR POWELL.
326,And so that’s another thing.,CHAIR POWELL.
327,"The other one is, we will eventually get relief on the supply side.",CHAIR POWELL.
328,"And, you know, the ports will be cleared up.",CHAIR POWELL.
329,And there will be semiconductors and things like that.,CHAIR POWELL.
330,"Now, what we’re learning is, it’s just taking much longer, so I think—longer than expected.",CHAIR POWELL.
331,"And that, I think, does raise, raise the risk that high inflation will be more persistent.",CHAIR POWELL.
332,I do think we’ll come off of the highs that we saw in the early part of this episode in the—in the spring last year.,CHAIR POWELL.
333,"But, really, what’s—the question is going to be, what is inflation running at?",CHAIR POWELL.
334,And so we’ll be watching that.,CHAIR POWELL.
335,"And I, you know, we—our objective is to get inflation back down to 2 percent.",CHAIR POWELL.
336,It’s also to provide enough support to keep the labor market healthy.,CHAIR POWELL.
337,"The labor market is very, very strong right now, and I think that that strength will continue.",CHAIR POWELL.
338,There’s a—there’s really a shortage of workers.,CHAIR POWELL.
339,We see it particularly among production and nonsupervisory workers and people in the lowest quartile.,CHAIR POWELL.
340,You see very large wage increases.,CHAIR POWELL.
341,I mentioned some of the other indicators.,CHAIR POWELL.
342,"So I think that’s, that’s what we’re looking at.",CHAIR POWELL.
343,"And we’re also—you know, we realize, I think, as everyone does, that this outlook is quite uncertain and that we’re going to have to adapt.",CHAIR POWELL.
344,And we’re going to communicate as clearly as we can.,CHAIR POWELL.
345,"But we’re going to have to be adaptable and, you know, move, move as appropriate.",CHAIR POWELL.
346,Great.,JEANNA SMIALEK.
347,Thank you.,JEANNA SMIALEK.
348,"Thank you, Michelle.",COLBY SMITH.
349,"Chair Powell, when you talk about being humble and nimble about the path forward for monetary policy, does that also include the possibility of raising interest rates by larger increments and, say, doing a 50 basis point hike at some point if inflation does not moderate sufficiently?",COLBY SMITH.
350,And should we interpret this approach as a departure from the gradual pace that we saw during the last hiking cycle?,COLBY SMITH.
351,"So, as I mentioned, we have not made these decisions.",CHAIR POWELL.
352,We really haven’t.,CHAIR POWELL.
353,"And, and what I can tell you now, though, is that we fully appreciate that this is a different situation.",CHAIR POWELL.
354,"If you look back to where we were in 2015, ’16, ’17, ’18 when we were raising rates, inflation was very close to 2 percent, even below 2 percent.",CHAIR POWELL.
355,"Unemployment was, was not at our estimates of the natural rate.",CHAIR POWELL.
356,"And growth was, you know, in the 2 to 3 percent range.",CHAIR POWELL.
357,"Right now, we have inflation running substantially above 2 percent and, and, you know, more persistently than we would like.",CHAIR POWELL.
358,"We have growth—even in forecasts, even in the somewhat reduced forecast for 2022—we still see growth higher than, substantially higher than what we estimate to be the potential growth rate.",CHAIR POWELL.
359,"And we see a labor market where, by so many measures, it is historically tight.",CHAIR POWELL.
360,"I think the—you know, in a way, the least tight aspect of it is, is looking at the unemployment rate, which is still below our median estimate of, of [the unemployment rate consistent with] maximum employment.",CHAIR POWELL.
361,"If you look at things like quits and job openings, as I mentioned earlier, and wages, you’re seeing—and, and just the ratio of job openings to unemployed—you’re seeing a very, very tight labor market.",CHAIR POWELL.
362,"Now, we also know that labor force participation is significantly lower.",CHAIR POWELL.
363,It’s 1½ percentage points lower than it was in February of 2020.,CHAIR POWELL.
364,Maybe a [full] percentage point of rather than just regular retirements.,CHAIR POWELL.
365,"So we think there’s, there’s a pool of people out there who could come back into the labor force.",CHAIR POWELL.
366,"But it’s not happening very quickly, and it may not—it may continue to not happen very quickly as long as the pandemic is on[going].",CHAIR POWELL.
367,"So that’s, that’s, that’s how we think about that.",CHAIR POWELL.
368,We haven’t made—to your specific question—we really have not addressed those questions.,CHAIR POWELL.
369,And we’ll begin to address them as we—as we move into the March meeting and meetings after that.,CHAIR POWELL.
370,Let’s go to Rachel.,MICHELLE SMITH.
371,"Thank you, Michelle.",RACHEL SIEGEL.
372,"And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions.",RACHEL SIEGEL.
373,"I’m wondering if you can talk to us about any metrics that the Fed uses to assess how inflation affects different groups of Americans, especially lower-, lower-income earners?",RACHEL SIEGEL.
374,"And are you worried that the Fed underestimates, or can’t effectively measure, the impact of inflation on some of the most vulnerable households?",RACHEL SIEGEL.
375,Thank you.,RACHEL SIEGEL.
376,"So it’s, it’s more a matter of—I think the problem that we’re—that we’re talking about here is really that people who are on fixed incomes who are living paycheck to paycheck, they’re spending most or all of their—of, of what they’re earning on food, gasoline, rent, heating their—heating, things like that, basic necessities.",CHAIR POWELL.
377,"And so inflation right away, right away forces people like that to make very difficult decisions.",CHAIR POWELL.
378,So that’s really the point.,CHAIR POWELL.
379,"I don’t—I’m not aware of, you know, inflation literally falling more on, on different socioeconomic groups.",CHAIR POWELL.
380,It’s—that’s not the point.,CHAIR POWELL.
381,"The point is, some people are just really in a—prone to suffer more.",CHAIR POWELL.
382,"I mean, for people who are economically well off, inflation isn’t good.",CHAIR POWELL.
383,It’s bad.,CHAIR POWELL.
384,"High inflation is, is bad, but they’re going to be able to continue to eat and keep their homes and drive we, we have to control inflation for the benefit of all Americans.",CHAIR POWELL.
385,"But part of—part of it is just that it’s particularly hard on people with fixed incomes and low incomes who spent most of their—of their income on necessities, which are—which are experiencing high inflation now.",CHAIR POWELL.
386,Thank you.,MICHELLE SMITH.
387,Let’s go to Edward Lawrence.,MICHELLE SMITH.
388,"Thanks, Michelle, and thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question here.",EDWARD LAWRENCE.
389,"So year over year, inflation’s at a 40-year high.",EDWARD LAWRENCE.
390,The [increase in] input costs for producer price index for all of 2021 was the highest on record.,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
391,Some investors fear that the Fed might be moving too late.,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
392,"Now, you said no decisions were made on the path of rate hikes, but was a rate hike more than 25 basis points discussed today?",EDWARD LAWRENCE.
393,"And as a follow to that—because I have problems with the mute button—as a follow to that, you testified that the supply chain issues could be worked out by the end of the year.",EDWARD LAWRENCE.
394,You talked about that today.,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
395,"The CEO of Ford, though, told Fox Business today that the chip shortage will last into 2023.",EDWARD LAWRENCE.
396,So today you said inflation will start to ease this year.,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
397,I want to drill down and get a timeline that you see as to when we could see that relief.,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
398,Thank you.,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
399,"So I, I would not say that I would expect the supply chain issues to be completely worked out by the end of this year.",CHAIR POWELL.
400,"I do not expect them, and I have not expected them.",CHAIR POWELL.
401,"What I would say, and I have been saying, is that I expect progress to be made in the second half of this year, mainly—progress because we’re not making much progress.",CHAIR POWELL.
402,"If you look at a ton of metrics, you can find some that suggest that delivery times are shorter and inventories in some industries moving up.",CHAIR POWELL.
403,"But, overall, we’re not—we’re not making progress.",CHAIR POWELL.
404,"And, you know, things like the semiconductor issue are going to—they’re going to be quite a long time.",CHAIR POWELL.
405,"I would think they’ll go more than through 2023. be positioned to address the full range of plausible outcomes, as I said, and particularly the possibility that inflation will continue to run higher, more persistently than we’d expected.",CHAIR POWELL.
406,"And we think we are positioned to make the changes in our policy to do that, and, and we’re committed to doing that.",CHAIR POWELL.
407,"And that’s, that’s really where we are.",CHAIR POWELL.
408,"In terms of your, your question about the, the size of rate increases, we haven’t—we haven’t faced those decisions.",CHAIR POWELL.
409,We haven’t made them.,CHAIR POWELL.
410,It isn’t possible to sit down here today and tell you with any confidence what the—what the precise path will be.,CHAIR POWELL.
411,"But in—as we work our way through this, meeting by meeting, we are aware that this is a very different, different expansion, as I’ve said a couple times, with higher inflation, higher growth, a much stronger economy.",CHAIR POWELL.
412,And I think those differences are likely to be reflected in—in the policy that we implement.,CHAIR POWELL.
413,Thank you.,MICHELLE SMITH.
414,Let’s go to Mike McKee.,MICHELLE SMITH.
415,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",MICHAEL MCKEE.
416,"I’d like to sort of weave some of the strands of your answers together and ask you, as you start to reverse policy, what your goal is.",MICHAEL MCKEE.
417,Are you going to be raising interest rates until you get inflation to 2 percent?,MICHAEL MCKEE.
418,"Do you want to go below 2 percent so that, on average, you get a 2 percent inflation rate?",MICHAEL MCKEE.
419,"And because you said we have to protect the employment part of your mandate, is there some sort of circuit breaker that would stop you from raising interest rates on the employment side?",MICHAEL MCKEE.
420,"So, no.",CHAIR POWELL.
421,"There’s no—there’s nothing in our framework about having inflation run below 2 percent so that we would do that, try to achieve that outcome.",CHAIR POWELL.
422,"So the answer to that is, is “no.”  What we’re trying to do is get inflation, keep inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent.",CHAIR POWELL.
423,"That’s, that’s always the, the ultimate goal.",CHAIR POWELL.
424,"And we do that in the And if inflation doesn’t average 2 percent over time, then it’s not clear why inflation expectations would be anchored at 2 percent.",CHAIR POWELL.
425,"So that, that’s the way we think about that.",CHAIR POWELL.
426,"You know, it—what was the last part of your—of your question?",CHAIR POWELL.
427,"I was asking if you’re protecting the employment side of the mandate, whether there’s some sort of circuit breaker there.",MICHAEL MCKEE.
428,Nothing like that.,CHAIR POWELL.
429,"I mean, I would say you have a tremendously strong labor market.",CHAIR POWELL.
430,And you have growth this year at—forecast to be well above—well above potential.,CHAIR POWELL.
431,"I mean, people who are forecasting growth think potential growth is around 2 [percent].",CHAIR POWELL.
432,"Most forecasts [of actual growth] are significantly above that for 2022, and that’s even with, with policy becoming substantially less accommodative.",CHAIR POWELL.
433,So the labor market’s going to be strong for some time.,CHAIR POWELL.
434,"We’re—ideally, what we’re trying to achieve is inflation getting back down to 2 percent.",CHAIR POWELL.
435,"And we’re trying to do that in a process that, that, that accomplishes—you know, that will also leave the labor market in a very strong position.",CHAIR POWELL.
436,And no one really knows what that will take.,CHAIR POWELL.
437,"Again, I would say that it isn’t just monetary policy that’s helping inflation get down.",CHAIR POWELL.
438,"It’ll be supply-side improvements, and it’ll be less, less fiscal, you know, less fiscal impulse in all likelihood.",CHAIR POWELL.
439,So—but monetary policy will do our job.,CHAIR POWELL.
440,It is our job to get inflation down to 2 percent.,CHAIR POWELL.
441,"And a situation where, where the two goals are—the two goals can be in tension is a difficult one.",CHAIR POWELL.
442,"But I—but I don’t really think they are here, though, because I think a really significant threat to further strengthening in the labor market in the form of higher participation over time is high inflation.",CHAIR POWELL.
443,"And also, high inflation is taking away the benefits of some of these larger wage those goals.",CHAIR POWELL.
444,"If I could—if I could follow up, does the danger of tightening too much as policy works its way into the economy with a lag mean that you should go back to being more forecast dependent in making decisions, rather than the state dependency you’ve been using as a framework for the last year and a half or so?",MICHAEL MCKEE.
445,"State dependency was particularly around the thought that if we—if we saw a very strong labor market, we would wait to see actual inflation—actual inflation before we tightened.",CHAIR POWELL.
446,"And so that was a very state-dependent thought because, for a long time, we’d been tightening on the expectation of high inflation, which never appeared.",CHAIR POWELL.
447,"And that was the case for, for a number of years.",CHAIR POWELL.
448,"So in this particular situation, we will be clearly monitoring incoming data as well as the evolving outlook.",CHAIR POWELL.
449,Let’s go to Michael Derby.,MICHELLE SMITH.
450,Thank you for taking my question.,MICHAEL DERBY.
451,"I want to ask you, with the benefit of hindsight, and I realize, I mean, that is what it is.",MICHAEL DERBY.
452,"But do you feel that, you know, monetary policy and fiscal policy maybe did too much to react to the crisis and that part of the inflation problem that we’re having right now is because the government response, you know, collectively was more than what the economy ended up needing?",MICHAEL DERBY.
453,"So I think it’s too soon to write that history, really.",CHAIR POWELL.
454,But what I would say is this.,CHAIR POWELL.
455,"The—if you remember what it felt like at the beginning of the pandemic, literally the global economy shutting down in large part, including our own economy, and people going to their homes for weeks on end in masks, and there are no vaccines, and it could be a really long shocking amount in one—so there was a real risk of lasting damage.",CHAIR POWELL.
456,"And I think Congress responded remarkably with the—with the CARES Act, incredibly timely and very powerful.",CHAIR POWELL.
457,People will—there’ll always be flaws in these things.,CHAIR POWELL.
458,"But in real time, it was a remarkable achievement.",CHAIR POWELL.
459,And we responded.,CHAIR POWELL.
460,"And what we were able to do was, you know, stave off a collapse of the financial system at the beginning and make time for what really needed to happen, which was the income replacement and then the recovery that Congress enabled with the CARES Act.",CHAIR POWELL.
461,"So now, that was a lot of—that was a lot.",CHAIR POWELL.
462,And what we did was a lot.,CHAIR POWELL.
463,"And, you know, now—so, what we have now is, we have the strongest recovery of any, any country.",CHAIR POWELL.
464,"And we have—we have a recovery that looks completely unlike other recoveries that we’ve had, because we’ve, we’ve put so much support behind the recovery.",CHAIR POWELL.
465,"And we’re managing the, the relatively high-class problems that come with that, which are high inflation and a labor shortage.",CHAIR POWELL.
466,"So—and these are serious problems, very serious problems that we, you know, we’re working as hard as we can on.",CHAIR POWELL.
467,Was it too much?,CHAIR POWELL.
468,"Again, I’m going to leave that to the historians.",CHAIR POWELL.
469,"And—but look, in 25 years, we’ll look back at this incident, which will be a, you know, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-year period.",CHAIR POWELL.
470,"And we’ll say, you know, we’ll have a—we’ll have a much better basis to make a judgment about the actions that people took.",CHAIR POWELL.
471,"But it was all founded, though, in a—in a very strong reaction to a, you know, to a unique historical event.",CHAIR POWELL.
472,And I guess I’ll have to leave it at that.,CHAIR POWELL.
473,I look for—I hope I’ll be around to see how that looks in 25 years.,CHAIR POWELL.
474,Fair enough.,MICHAEL DERBY.
475,Thank you.,MICHAEL DERBY.
476,Thank you.,MICHELLE SMITH.
477,Let’s go to Jean Yung.,MICHELLE SMITH.
478,"curve could flatten, or even invert, after rate hikes begin.",MICHELLE SMITH.
479,"Would that worry you, and how important is that risk in the Fed’s consideration for adjusting policy?",MICHELLE SMITH.
480,"So we, we do monitor the slope of the yield curve, but we don’t control the slope of the yield curve.",CHAIR POWELL.
481,Many flat—many factors influence longer-term interest rates.,CHAIR POWELL.
482,"But it is something that we watch, and, and you will know that from when we had this issue a few years ago.",CHAIR POWELL.
483,"And we take it into account, along with many other financial conditions, as we try to assess the implications of all those conditions for the economic outlook.",CHAIR POWELL.
484,"So that’s, that’s one thing I would say.",CHAIR POWELL.
485,"Another is, currently, you’ve got a slope.",CHAIR POWELL.
486,"If you think about 2s to 10s, 2-year Treasury to 10-year Treasury, I think that’s around 75 basis points.",CHAIR POWELL.
487,That’s well within the range of a normal—of a normal yield-curve slope.,CHAIR POWELL.
488,So it’s something we’re monitoring.,CHAIR POWELL.
489,We don’t think of it as—I don’t think of it as some kind of an iron law.,CHAIR POWELL.
490,But we do look at it and try to understand the implications and what it’s telling us.,CHAIR POWELL.
491,And it’s—but it’s one of many things that we monitor.,CHAIR POWELL.
492,"Can I follow up real quick and ask, if it—if it did invert, would you tie it to U.S. fundamentals?",JEAN YUNG.
493,Or would it be driven by a much broader set of factors?,JEAN YUNG.
494,"We’d—that’s, that’s a good question in, in real time.",CHAIR POWELL.
495,"Obviously, U.S. long-term sovereign debt is an—is an important global asset.",CHAIR POWELL.
496,"And it—and the fact that our rates are so much higher than, than other risk-free sovereign rates around the world may put something of a ceiling on our—on our rates.",CHAIR POWELL.
497,I don’t know.,CHAIR POWELL.
498,But it would really depend on the—on the facts and circumstances at that time.,CHAIR POWELL.
499,Thank you.,MICHELLE SMITH.
500,Let’s go to Brian Cheung for the last question.,MICHELLE SMITH.
501,"context of just the broad effort to normalize rates, would you describe what you want to do as a gradual hiking?",MICHELLE SMITH.
502,"And then, secondly, within the context of hiking cycles, it’s often the talking point for financial stability and wanting to make sure that asset bubbles don’t emerge.",MICHELLE SMITH.
503,Is that something that has also factored into the conversation as you start to think about hiking rates?,MICHELLE SMITH.
504,Thanks.,MICHELLE SMITH.
505,I would describe what we’re doing along these lines.,CHAIR POWELL.
506,This is going to be a year in which we move steadily away from the very highly accommodative monetary policy that we put in place to deal with the—with the economic effects of the pandemic.,CHAIR POWELL.
507,And that’s going to involve a number of things.,CHAIR POWELL.
508,It’s going to involve and does involve finishing asset purchases.,CHAIR POWELL.
509,It’s going to involve lifting off.,CHAIR POWELL.
510,And it’s going to involve additional rate increases as appropriate.,CHAIR POWELL.
511,"And we, we have—we’re going to write down in March our next assessment of what that might be.",CHAIR POWELL.
512,It’s going to continue to evolve as the data evolve.,CHAIR POWELL.
513,"We need to be quite adaptable, I think, in our understanding of this.",CHAIR POWELL.
514,"The last thing we’re going to do is, we’re going to have a couple more meetings, I think, to talk about allowing the balance sheet to begin to run off and [to] do so in a predictable manner.",CHAIR POWELL.
515,"And that’s, that’s something that we will also be doing as appropriate.",CHAIR POWELL.
516,And I wouldn’t—I don’t think it’s possible to say exactly how this is going to go.,CHAIR POWELL.
517,"And we’re, we’re going to need to be, as I’ve mentioned, nimble about this.",CHAIR POWELL.
518,And the economy is quite different this time.,CHAIR POWELL.
519,I’ve said this several times now.,CHAIR POWELL.
520,The economy is quite different.,CHAIR POWELL.
521,It’s stronger.,CHAIR POWELL.
522,Inflation is higher.,CHAIR POWELL.
523,"The labor market is much, much stronger than it was.",CHAIR POWELL.
524,"And growth is above trend, even this year, let alone last year.",CHAIR POWELL.
525,So all of those things are going to go into our thinking as we make—as we make monetary policy.,CHAIR POWELL.
526,And question?,CHAIR POWELL.
527,Yes.,BRIAN CHEUNG.
528,"Within the context of other hiking cycles, it seems like [a set of] worries about asset bubbles emerging as a result of easy rates has been part of that .",BRIAN CHEUNG.
529,I didn’t know if that was part of the discussion today.,BRIAN CHEUNG.
530,I would just say this.,CHAIR POWELL.
531,"We, we, of course, have a financial stability framework.",CHAIR POWELL.
532,"And what it shows is a number of, of positive aspects of financial stability.",CHAIR POWELL.
533,"But you mentioned, really, [the behavior of] asset prices is one of the four.",CHAIR POWELL.
534,"So asset prices are somewhat elevated, and they reflect a high risk appetite and that sort of thing.",CHAIR POWELL.
535,"I don’t really think asset prices themselves represent a significant threat to financial stability, and that’s because households are in good shape financially than they have been.",CHAIR POWELL.
536,Businesses are in good shape financially.,CHAIR POWELL.
537,Defaults on business loans are low and that kind of thing.,CHAIR POWELL.
538,The banks are highly capitalized with high liquidity and quite resilient and strong.,CHAIR POWELL.
539,"There are some concerns in the—in the nonbank financial sector around—still around money market funds, although the SEC is making—has made some very positive proposals there.",CHAIR POWELL.
540,"And we also saw some things in the Treasury market during the acute phase of the crisis, which, which we’re looking at ways to address.",CHAIR POWELL.
541,"But, overall, the financial stability vulnerabilities are manageable—are manageable, I would say.",CHAIR POWELL.
542,Thank you very much.,MICHELLE SMITH.
