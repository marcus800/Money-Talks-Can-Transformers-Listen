0,Good afternoon.,CHAIR YELLEN.
1,"Today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing it to ¾ to 1 percent.",CHAIR YELLEN.
2,Our decision to make another gradual reduction in the amount of policy accommodation reflects the economy’s continued progress toward the employment and price stability objectives assigned to us by law.,CHAIR YELLEN.
3,"For some time the Committee has judged that, if economic conditions evolved as anticipated, gradual increases in the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate to achieve and maintain our objectives.",CHAIR YELLEN.
4,Today’s decision is in line with that view and does not represent a reassessment of the economic outlook or of the appropriate course for monetary policy.,CHAIR YELLEN.
5,"I’ll have more to say about monetary policy shortly, but first I’ll review recent economic developments and the outlook.",CHAIR YELLEN.
6,The economy continues to expand at a moderate pace.,CHAIR YELLEN.
7,Solid income gains and relatively high levels of consumer sentiment and wealth have supported household spending growth.,CHAIR YELLEN.
8,"Business investment, which was soft for much of last year, has firmed somewhat, and business sentiment is at favorable levels.",CHAIR YELLEN.
9,"Overall, we continue to expect that the economy will expand at a moderate pace over the next few years.",CHAIR YELLEN.
10,"Job gains averaged about 200,000 per month over the past three months, maintaining the solid pace we have seen over the past year.",CHAIR YELLEN.
11,"The unemployment rate was 4.7 percent in February, near its recent low.",CHAIR YELLEN.
12,Broader measures of labor market underutilization also remain low.,CHAIR YELLEN.
13,"Participation in the labor force has been little changed, on net, for about three years.",CHAIR YELLEN.
14,"Given the underlying downward trend in participation stemming largely from the aging of the U.S. population, a relatively steady participation rate is a further sign of improving conditions in the labor market.",CHAIR YELLEN.
15,"Looking ahead, we expect that job conditions will strengthen somewhat further.",CHAIR YELLEN.
16,"expenditures rose to nearly 2 percent in January, up from less than 1 percent last summer.",CHAIR YELLEN.
17,"That rise was largely driven by energy prices, which have been increasing recently after earlier declines.",CHAIR YELLEN.
18,Core inflation—which excludes volatile energy and food prices and tends to be a better indicator of future inflation—has been little changed in recent months at about 1¾ percent.,CHAIR YELLEN.
19,"We expect core inflation to move up and overall inflation to stabilize around 2 percent over the next couple of years, in line with our longer-run objective.",CHAIR YELLEN.
20,Let me now turn to the economic projections that were submitted for this meeting by Committee participants.,CHAIR YELLEN.
21,"As always, participants conditioned their projections on their own individual views of appropriate monetary policy, which, in turn, depend on each participant’s assessment of the many factors that shape the outlook.",CHAIR YELLEN.
22,"The median projection for growth of inflation-adjusted gross domestic product is 2.1 percent this year and next, and edges down to 1.9 percent in 2019, slightly above its estimated longer-run rate.",CHAIR YELLEN.
23,"The median projection for the unemployment rate stands at 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and remains at that level over the next two years, modestly below the median estimate of its longer-run normal rate.",CHAIR YELLEN.
24,"Finally, the median inflation projection is 1.9 percent this year and rises to 2 percent in 2018 and 2019.",CHAIR YELLEN.
25,These economic projections are very little changed from those made in December.,CHAIR YELLEN.
26,"Returning to monetary policy, the Committee judged that a modest increase in the federal funds rate is appropriate in light of the economy’s solid progress toward our goals of maximum employment and price stability.",CHAIR YELLEN.
27,"Even after this increase, monetary policy remains accommodative, thus supporting some further strengthening in the job market and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.",CHAIR YELLEN.
28,Today’s decision also reflects our view that waiting too long to scale back some accommodation could potentially require us to raise rates rapidly sometime into recession.,CHAIR YELLEN.
29,We continue to expect that the ongoing strength of the economy will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate to achieve and maintain our objectives.,CHAIR YELLEN.
30,"That’s based on our view that the neutral nominal federal funds rate—that is, the interest rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel—is currently quite low by historical standards.",CHAIR YELLEN.
31,That means that the federal funds rate does not have to rise by all that much to get to a neutral policy stance.,CHAIR YELLEN.
32,"We also expect the neutral level of the federal funds rate to rise somewhat over time, meaning that additional gradual rate hikes are likely to be appropriate over the next few years to sustain the economic expansion.",CHAIR YELLEN.
33,"Even so, the Committee continues to anticipate that the longer-run neutral level of the federal funds rate is still likely to remain below levels that prevailed in previous decades.",CHAIR YELLEN.
34,This view is consistent with participants’ projections of appropriate monetary policy.,CHAIR YELLEN.
35,"The median projection for the federal funds rate is 1.4 percent at the end of this year, 2.1 percent at the end of next year, and 3 percent at the end of 2019, in line with its estimated longer-run value.",CHAIR YELLEN.
36,"Compared with the projections made in December, the median path for the federal funds rate is essentially unchanged.",CHAIR YELLEN.
37,"As always, the economic outlook is highly uncertain, and participants will adjust their assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes to their economic outlooks and views of the risks to their outlooks.",CHAIR YELLEN.
38,"Changes in economic policies, including fiscal and other policies, could potentially affect the economic outlook.",CHAIR YELLEN.
39,"Of course, it is still too early to know how these policies will unfold.",CHAIR YELLEN.
40,"Moreover, fiscal policy is only one of many factors that can influence the outlook.",CHAIR YELLEN.
41,"In making our decisions, we will continue—as policy is not on a preset course.",CHAIR YELLEN.
42,"Finally, we will continue to reinvest proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities.",CHAIR YELLEN.
43,"This policy, by keeping the Committee’s holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, has helped maintain accommodative financial conditions.",CHAIR YELLEN.
44,"As a matter of prudent planning, we discussed at this meeting a number of issues related to an eventual change to our reinvestment policy.",CHAIR YELLEN.
45,"We made no decisions, and we will continue our discussion at subsequent meetings.",CHAIR YELLEN.
46,"In keeping with the principle that the process of normalizing our balance sheet will be gradual and predictable, we will provide more information about our plans as it becomes available.",CHAIR YELLEN.
47,Thank you.,CHAIR YELLEN.
48,I’d be happy to take your questions.,CHAIR YELLEN.
49,Thanks very much.,SAM FLEMING.
50,Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.,SAM FLEMING.
51,"Could I take you up on the last topic, which is the balance sheet normalization?",SAM FLEMING.
52,"Clearly you said you don’t want to start pulling in the size of the balance sheet until normalization “is well under way.”  Could you give us some sort of sense about what “well under way” means, at least in your mind?",SAM FLEMING.
53,What kind of hurdles are you setting?,SAM FLEMING.
54,What kind of economic conditions would you like to see?,SAM FLEMING.
55,Is it just a matter of the level of the short-term federal funds rate as being the main issue?,SAM FLEMING.
56,And what kind of role do you see the role of the balance sheet playing in the normalization process over the longer term?,SAM FLEMING.
57,"Is it an active tool, or is it a passive tool?",SAM FLEMING.
58,Thanks.,SAM FLEMING.
59,So let me start with the second question first.,CHAIR YELLEN.
60,We’ve emphasized for quite some time that the Committee wishes to use variations in the fed funds rate target—our short-term interest rate target—as our key active tool of policy.,CHAIR YELLEN.
61,We think it’s much easier in using that tool to communicate the stance of policy.,CHAIR YELLEN.
62,"We have much more experience with it and a tool that we could conceivably resort to if we found ourselves in a serious downturn where we were, again, up against the zero bound and faced with substantial weakness in the economy, it’s not a tool that we would want to use as a routine tool of policy.",CHAIR YELLEN.
63,You asked what “well under way” means.,CHAIR YELLEN.
64,I can’t give you a specific answer to that.,CHAIR YELLEN.
65,And I think the right—the right way to look at it is in qualitative and not quantitative terms.,CHAIR YELLEN.
66,"It doesn’t mean some particular cutoff level for the federal funds rate that, when we’ve reached that level, we would consider ourselves well under way.",CHAIR YELLEN.
67,"I think what we want to have is confidence in the economy’s trajectory, a sense that the economy will make progress, that we’re not overly worried about downside risks and adverse shocks that could hit the economy that could quickly—after setting it off on the path to shrinking the balance sheet gradually over time—cause us to want to begin to add monetary policy accommodation.",CHAIR YELLEN.
68,So I think it has to do with the balance of risks and confidence in the economic outlook and not simply the level of the federal funds rate.,CHAIR YELLEN.
69,"Hi, thank you.",JASON LANGE.
70,Jason Lange with Reuters.,JASON LANGE.
71,You mentioned that you don’t—that you don’t—you want to not have to raise rates rapidly if you were to fall behind the curve.,JASON LANGE.
72,"In the current context, “gradual” has been very, very gradual.",JASON LANGE.
73,Could you describe what a rapid rate of increases should be—how that should be understood?,JASON LANGE.
74,So I’m not sure that I can tell you what “a rapid rate of increases” is.,CHAIR YELLEN.
75,"I think the trajectory that you see is the median in our projections, which, this year, looks to a total of three increases.",CHAIR YELLEN.
76,That certainly qualifies as gradual.,CHAIR YELLEN.
77,"My comfort in using the term “gradual” comes back, in part, to my judgment that the neutral level of the federal funds rate—namely, the level of the federal funds rate that would keep the economy operating on an even accelerator—that level of interest rates is quite low.",CHAIR YELLEN.
78,"So, at present, I see monetary policy as accommodative—namely, the current level of the federal funds rate is below that neutral rate, but not very far below the neutral rate.",CHAIR YELLEN.
79,"We’re closing in, I think, on our employment objective.",CHAIR YELLEN.
80,We’re coming closer on our inflation objective.,CHAIR YELLEN.
81,"As we reach those objectives, and particularly in light of the fact that we see the risks to the outlook as roughly balanced at this point—and that’s been our assessment for the last several meetings—it looks to us to be appropriate to gradually raise the federal funds rate back in the direction of neutral.",CHAIR YELLEN.
82,And exactly how many increases is that?,CHAIR YELLEN.
83,"You know, the SEP gives you a sense of what Committee participants envision in a concrete sense.",CHAIR YELLEN.
84,"But, you know, if it’s one more or one less, I think that still—that still qualifies to my mind as gradual, I think, if you compare it with any previous tightening cycle.",CHAIR YELLEN.
85,I remember when rates were raised at every meeting starting in mid-2004.,CHAIR YELLEN.
86,"And I think people thought that was a gradual pace, a measured pace.",CHAIR YELLEN.
87,And we’re certainly not envisioning something like that.,CHAIR YELLEN.
88,"Steve Liesman, CNBC.",STEVE LIESMAN.
89,"Both the OECD and the IMF have raised their forecasts, in part because of—for the U.S. growth—in part because of the policies expected from the new Administration, yet the Fed has not.",STEVE LIESMAN.
90,And I take it from your comment at the very beginning that this—these forecasts today represent no reassessment.,STEVE LIESMAN.
91,Has the Committee discussed what policy might look like in the event that there are large tax cuts passed or infrastructure spending passed?,STEVE LIESMAN.
92,And what might policy look like if those policies become law?,STEVE LIESMAN.
93,"Finally, why did you remove the word “only” before the word “gradual” when you talked about future rate increases?",STEVE LIESMAN.
94,So we have not discussed in detail potential policy changes that could policy measures.,CHAIR YELLEN.
95,"We recognize that there is great uncertainty about the timing, the size, the character of policy changes that may be put in place and don’t think that that’s a decision, or a set of decisions, that we need to make until we know more about what policy changes will go into effect.",CHAIR YELLEN.
96,"So I do want to emphasize that, while some participants have penciled in some fiscal policy changes into their projections, that the basis for today’s decision is simply our assessment of the progress of the economy against our long-established goals of maximum employment and price stability.",CHAIR YELLEN.
97,There’s nothing that we have done or anticipate that is a speculation.,CHAIR YELLEN.
98,"I think it’s fair to say, there’s nothing that’s a speculation about preemptive responses to future policy moves.",CHAIR YELLEN.
99,We have plenty of time to see what happens.,CHAIR YELLEN.
100,We did remove the word “only” in the statement today from “gradual.”  I think this is something that shouldn’t be overinterpreted.,CHAIR YELLEN.
101,"I regard it as a relatively small change and think it’s appropriate for you to consider it in the context, for example, of the fact that our economic projections are virtually identical to those that we issued in December.",CHAIR YELLEN.
102,They’re essentially unchanged both in terms of the path of the economy and the path of the federal funds rate.,CHAIR YELLEN.
103,So we have carried out a modest adjustment of the federal funds rate because we’ve seen the economy progressing over the last several months in exactly the way that we anticipated.,CHAIR YELLEN.
104,We haven’t in any way changed our view about where the economy is heading or the risks.,CHAIR YELLEN.
105,"We had long said that if the economy progressed, and—it’s, you know, it’s been doing nicely, I think, in making progress, in showing resilience, and we have, you know, have some confidence in the path the economy is on.",CHAIR YELLEN.
106,"And if we continue to feel that, we will likely regard it as appropriate to make some further moves to scale back accommodation to move toward neutral, along the lines in the SEP. “gradual,” I think, emphasizes that if things continue in the manner that we’ve been going, as we have said now for quite some time, we think that gradual—some gradual increases in the federal funds rate—will be appropriate.",CHAIR YELLEN.
107,"And this is not a, you know, this is not a significant—this is not a significant change.",CHAIR YELLEN.
108,"Peter Barnes, Fox Business, ma’am.",PETER BARNES.
109,"Speaking of fiscal policy, have you had a chance to meet with the new Treasury Secretary yet, Mr. Mnuchin?",PETER BARNES.
110,"If not, when will you meet with him?",PETER BARNES.
111,What do you want to talk to him about?,PETER BARNES.
112,"And, separately, have you had a chance to talk to President Trump yet or meet with him?",PETER BARNES.
113,"And, if not, would you like to, and would you, and what would you talk about?",PETER BARNES.
114,Thank you.,PETER BARNES.
115,"I’ve met a couple of times with the Treasury Secretary, and I’m getting to know him.",CHAIR YELLEN.
116,"And I think, you know, it’s traditional for Fed Chairs and Treasury Secretaries to meet on a regular basis, and I fully expect to have a strong relationship with Secretary Mnuchin.",CHAIR YELLEN.
117,"We have had very good discussions about the economy, about regulatory objectives, the work of the FSOC, global economic developments, and I look forward to continuing to work with him.",CHAIR YELLEN.
118,I was introduced to the President.,CHAIR YELLEN.
119,I had a very brief meeting and appreciated that as well.,CHAIR YELLEN.
120,"Ana Swanson, the Washington Post.",ANA SWANSON.
121,You said that the neutral level of the federal funds rate is quite low.,ANA SWANSON.
122,How close do you judge it to be to the inflation rate?,ANA SWANSON.
123,And what do you anticipate will be the force pushing up the neutral interest rate over the next few years?,ANA SWANSON.
124,Could fiscal policy be among those?,ANA SWANSON.
125,So I’ve given a number of recent speeches on this topic where I’ve developed my views more fully.,CHAIR YELLEN.
126,"I would say, over the longer run—that means going several that might be close to 1 percent or a little bit under that.",CHAIR YELLEN.
127,That would be consistent with the median longer-run value of the federal funds rate in our economic projections for the last several meetings.,CHAIR YELLEN.
128,Three percent is the longer-run normal federal funds rate that participants estimate.,CHAIR YELLEN.
129,"In real terms, with a 2 percent inflation objective—that’s 1 percent in real terms.",CHAIR YELLEN.
130,And I’ve indicated—why is it so low?,CHAIR YELLEN.
131,"Well, I think there’s very strong evidence that’s accumulated that this rate has been falling not just in the United States, but in many advanced nations, and the decline probably predates the financial crisis.",CHAIR YELLEN.
132,I think in part it reflects slowing population growth and also slow productivity growth here and in many other advanced nations.,CHAIR YELLEN.
133,"But some recent work suggests that, at the present time, the neutral real rate is yet lower than that, and some estimates place it around zero in real terms.",CHAIR YELLEN.
134,So I think the lower current rate arguably reflects headwinds that are left over from the financial crisis.,CHAIR YELLEN.
135,"One form of headwind, I think, has been caution and restraint and risk aversion on the part of households and businesses that’s held back spending decisions.",CHAIR YELLEN.
136,"And, I suppose, my judgment that it’ll move up over time reflects a notion that part of that will gradually dissipate over the years.",CHAIR YELLEN.
137,"So that’s a sense of where I think—now, there is uncertainty about the neutral rate.",CHAIR YELLEN.
138,"And, as you mentioned, it is—it can be affected by shifts in fiscal policy.",CHAIR YELLEN.
139,"How the neutral rate is affected by fiscal policy—that really depends importantly on the nature, the size of the fiscal shift and the effect it has both on demand and supply in the economy.",CHAIR YELLEN.
140,Thank you.,NICK TIMIRAOS.
141,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.,NICK TIMIRAOS.
142,"Chair Yellen, between the release of the minutes of the previous meeting late last month and your speech in Chicago earlier this month, market expectations about an increase in rates today changed quite dramatically.",NICK TIMIRAOS.
143,What happened over the course of those two weeks to make officials far more market was so out of sync with where the central bank was?,NICK TIMIRAOS.
144,"So, when I look at our sequence of communications, they seem to me to have been reasonably consistent over this entire period.",CHAIR YELLEN.
145,"We had indicated in December that we expect—we saw the risks as balanced, and if the economy continued to progress along the lines we expected, that several rate increases would likely be appropriate.",CHAIR YELLEN.
146,The minutes of our January meeting indicated that many participants thought that an increase in the funds rate would be appropriate fairly soon if things continued along those lines.,CHAIR YELLEN.
147,"I indicated in my congressional testimony that I thought that, indeed, the economy was progressing in line with our expectations.",CHAIR YELLEN.
148,"And, as I think all of us—having that expectation and that if the economy continued to progress along the lines that we expected and we continued to see the risks as balanced—do regard it as appropriate to gradually remove accommodation that’s in place by having several interest rate increases this year.",CHAIR YELLEN.
149,"As we saw the data continue to come in in line with our expectations, my colleagues and I spoke out and indicated that, indeed, that had been and continued to be our expectations.",CHAIR YELLEN.
150,"Now, you know, when you ask me, how did we get out of sync with the market, this is something I tried to reflect on a bit in the remarks I made in Chicago.",CHAIR YELLEN.
151,"And, of course, it is true that in 2015 and in 2016 each, we raised the federal funds rate only once, and perhaps market participants have been influenced by that pattern.",CHAIR YELLEN.
152,I did try to explain the reasons why we had moved so slowly during those two years.,CHAIR YELLEN.
153,"And it reflects, I think, a set of shocks partly emanating from the global economy and risks that we saw to the outlook as well as more fundamental assessments—reassessments pertaining to the neutral level of the federal funds rate and the longer-run normal level of the unemployment rate.",CHAIR YELLEN.
154,"So I think there are reasons, but it is policy is accommodative; that although the level of the neutral federal funds rate is probably quite low, we nevertheless have an accommodative stance of policy; and it will be appropriate to gradually move toward a neutral stance if we continue on the path we’re on.",CHAIR YELLEN.
155,"Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times.",BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.
156,"The Bank for International Settlements has raised concerns that central banks are being insufficiently attentive to asset price—excuse me, asset price inflation.",BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.
157,And stock market investors in the United States certainly don’t seem to be waiting for the Trump Administration to actually implement its fiscal policies.,BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.
158,And I guess I’m just curious to know how much of a concern that is for you.,BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.
159,"And, if not, why not, given the remarkably elevated level of stock price evaluations?",BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.
160,"Well, we do look at financial conditions in formulating our view of the outlook, and stock prices do figure into financial conditions.",CHAIR YELLEN.
161,So I think the higher level of stock prices is one factor that looks like it’s likely to somewhat boost consumption spending.,CHAIR YELLEN.
162,"We also noticed that, in the last several months, that risk spreads, particularly for lower-grade corporate issuers, have narrowed, which is another signal that financial conditions have become somewhat easier.",CHAIR YELLEN.
163,"Now, on the other side, longer-term interest rates are up some in recent months, and the dollar is a little stronger.",CHAIR YELLEN.
164,How does that net out?,CHAIR YELLEN.
165,There are private-sector analysts that produce financial conditions indices that attempt to aggregate all these different factors affecting financial conditions.,CHAIR YELLEN.
166,"And for some of the more prominent analysts and indices, I think the conclusion they have reached is that financial conditions, on balance, have eased, and that’s partly driven by the stock market.",CHAIR YELLEN.
167,So that is a factor that affects the outlook.,CHAIR YELLEN.
168,"Marty Crutsinger, Associated Press.",MARTIN CRUTSINGER.
169,You and Secretary Mnuchin will be meeting with your G-20 colleagues in Germany this weekend.,MARTIN CRUTSINGER.
170,"What do you is finally out of the woods, doing better?",MARTIN CRUTSINGER.
171,Or do you think that there’s still going to be worries about risk?,MARTIN CRUTSINGER.
172,And would one of those risk worries be that the Fed might raise rates too quickly?,MARTIN CRUTSINGER.
173,"Well, we always exchange views on the economic outlook and developments in our country, and it will be my objective to explain—explain U.S. monetary policy and to try to make the same points to them that I’ve made here already today about what the outlook is for monetary policy in the United States.",CHAIR YELLEN.
174,I think it’s fair to say that the global economy is doing better.,CHAIR YELLEN.
175,"It’s growing a bit more strongly than it was, perhaps, the last time I got together that the—with my counterparts in the G-20—that the risks do look somewhat more balanced.",CHAIR YELLEN.
176,"But there remain a set of very significant risks, medium term, facing the global economy, and I’m sure that those will be discussed as well.",CHAIR YELLEN.
177,"Hi, Jim Puzzanghera with the Los Angeles Times.",JIM PUZZANGHERA.
178,"You said you and your colleagues aren’t making assumptions about stimulative fiscal policies, but many other people are.",JIM PUZZANGHERA.
179,Business and consumer confidence has jumped since the election.,JIM PUZZANGHERA.
180,Homebuilder sentiment today was at its highest level since 2005.,JIM PUZZANGHERA.
181,"Are you concerned about the effects on the economy if some of these policies, such as tax cuts and infrastructure spending, don’t get enacted or are delayed?",JIM PUZZANGHERA.
182,"So we recognize—our statement actually last time noted that there had been an improvement, a marked improvement in business and household sentiment.",CHAIR YELLEN.
183,It’s uncertain just how much sentiment actually impacts spending decisions.,CHAIR YELLEN.
184,And I wouldn’t say at this point that I have seen hard evidence of any change in spending decisions based on expectations about the future.,CHAIR YELLEN.
185,"We exchange around the table what we learn from our many business contacts, and I think it’s fair to say that many of my colleagues and I note a much more the business people that we’ve talked to also have a wait-and-see attitude and are very hopeful that they will be able to expand investment and are looking forward to doing that but are waiting to see what will happen.",CHAIR YELLEN.
186,So we will watch that.,CHAIR YELLEN.
187,"And, of course, if we were to see a major shift in spending reflecting those expectations, that could very well affect the outlook.",CHAIR YELLEN.
188,"I’m not seeing it—I’m not seeing that at this point, but the shift in sentiment is obvious and notable.",CHAIR YELLEN.
189,"Thank you, Madam Chair.",KATE DAVIDSON.
190,Kate Davidson from Dow Jones.,KATE DAVIDSON.
191,There’s a perception out there that the Fed could somehow stand in the way of some of the economic growth policies that the new Administration is pursuing.,KATE DAVIDSON.
192,"Given that the Fed is projecting 1.8 percent growth in the long run, is this a potential point of conflict for the Fed and the new Administration?",KATE DAVIDSON.
193,So I don’t believe it is a point of conflict.,CHAIR YELLEN.
194,We would certainly welcome stronger economic growth in a context of price stability.,CHAIR YELLEN.
195,And if policies were put in place to speed growth that I’ve certainly urged Congress and the Administration to consider—policies that would boost productivity growth and raise the economy’s so-called speed limit or potential to grow—I think that those would be—those would be very welcome changes that we would like to see.,CHAIR YELLEN.
196,"Chair Yellen, Kathleen Hays.",KATHLEEN HAYS.
197,"Oh, excuse me, Kathleen Hays from Bloomberg.",KATHLEEN HAYS.
198,"I’m going to try to take the opposite side of this because—on this question about market expectations and how the markets got things wrong, and then how you say the Fed suddenly clarified what it already said.",KATHLEEN HAYS.
199,"But, for example, if the—if you look at the Atlanta Fed’s latest GDP tracker for the first quarter, it’s down to 0.9 percent.",KATHLEEN HAYS.
200,We had a retail sales report that was mixed.,KATHLEEN HAYS.
201,"Granted the, you know, upward revisions of previous months make it look better, and-see attitude you just mentioned.",KATHLEEN HAYS.
202,"If you look at measures of labor compensation, you note in the statement that they’re not moving up, and, in fact, they are.",KATHLEEN HAYS.
203,And if you look at average—there are so many things you can look at.,KATHLEEN HAYS.
204,And you yourself have said in the past that the fact that that is happening is perhaps an indication there’s still slack in the labor market.,KATHLEEN HAYS.
205,"I guess my question is this:  In another sense, what happened between December and March?",KATHLEEN HAYS.
206,GDP is tracking very low.,KATHLEEN HAYS.
207,Measures of labor compensation are not threatening to boost inflation any time fast.,KATHLEEN HAYS.
208,The consumer is not picking up very much.,KATHLEEN HAYS.
209,Fiscal policy—we don’t know what’s going to happen with Donald Trump.,KATHLEEN HAYS.
210,And yet you have to raise rates now.,KATHLEEN HAYS.
211,So what is the—what is the motivation here?,KATHLEEN HAYS.
212,"The economy is so far from your forecast in terms of GDP, why does the Fed have to move now?",KATHLEEN HAYS.
213,"What does this signal, then, about the rest of the year?",KATHLEEN HAYS.
214,So GDP is a pretty noisy indicator.,CHAIR YELLEN.
215,"If one averages through several quarters, I would describe our economy as one that has been growing around 2 percent per year.",CHAIR YELLEN.
216,"And as you can see from our projections, we—that’s something we expect to continue over the next couple of years.",CHAIR YELLEN.
217,"Now, that pace of growth has been consistent with a pace of job creation that is more rapid than what is sustainable if labor force participation begins to move down in line with what we see as its longer-run trend with an aging population.",CHAIR YELLEN.
218,"Now, unemployment hasn’t moved that much, in part because people have been drawn into the labor force.",CHAIR YELLEN.
219,"Labor force participation, as I mentioned in my remarks, has been about flat over the last three years.",CHAIR YELLEN.
220,"So, in that sense, the economy has shown over the last several years that it may have had more room to run than some people might have estimated, and that’s been there could be room left for that to play out further.",CHAIR YELLEN.
221,"In fact, look, policy remains accommodative.",CHAIR YELLEN.
222,We expect further improvement in the labor market.,CHAIR YELLEN.
223,We expect the unemployment rate to move down further and to stay down for the next several years.,CHAIR YELLEN.
224,So we do expect that the path of policy we think is appropriate is one that is going to lead to some further strengthening in the labor market.,CHAIR YELLEN.
225,"[Inaudible]  Just quickly, then, I just want to underscore—I want to ask you, so following on that, you expect it to move.",KATHLEEN HAYS.
226,But what if it doesn’t?,KATHLEEN HAYS.
227,What if GDP doesn’t pick up?,KATHLEEN HAYS.
228,What if you don’t see wage measures rising?,KATHLEEN HAYS.
229,What if you don’t—what if the core PCE gets stuck at 1.7 percent?,KATHLEEN HAYS.
230,"Would you—is it your view, perhaps, that if there’s a risk right now in the median forecast for dots, that it’s fewer hikes this year, rather than the consensus, or more?",KATHLEEN HAYS.
231,"Well, look, our policy is not set in stone.",CHAIR YELLEN.
232,"It is data dependent, and we’re—we’re not locked into any particular policy path.",CHAIR YELLEN.
233,"Our—you know, as you said, the data have not notably strengthened.",CHAIR YELLEN.
234,"I—there is noise always in the data from quarter to quarter, but we haven’t changed our view of the outlook.",CHAIR YELLEN.
235,"We think we’re on the same path, not—we haven’t boosted the outlook, projected faster growth.",CHAIR YELLEN.
236,"We think we’re moving along the same course we’ve been on, but it is one that involves gradual tightening in the labor market.",CHAIR YELLEN.
237,I would describe some measures of wage growth as having moved up some.,CHAIR YELLEN.
238,"Some measures haven’t moved up, but there’s some evidence that wage growth is gradually moving up, which is also suggestive of a strengthening labor market.",CHAIR YELLEN.
239,And we expect policy to remain accommodative now for some time.,CHAIR YELLEN.
240,So we’re—we’re talking about a gradual path of removing policy accommodation as the economy makes progress allowing it to grow at an above-trend pace that’s consistent with further improvement in the labor market.,CHAIR YELLEN.
241,"Hi, John Heltman with the American Banker.",JOHN HELTMAN.
242,"A regulatory question, if I may.",JOHN HELTMAN.
243,The Administration has recently reiterated its support for a reinstatement of Glass-Steagall.,JOHN HELTMAN.
244,"Treasury Secretary Mnuchin has called for a “21st century Glass-Steagall.”  Keeping in mind that there are no specifics on this proposal, is the fundamental idea of separating commercial banking from investment banking a fruitful line of inquiry?",JOHN HELTMAN.
245,Is this the right path to be pursuing?,JOHN HELTMAN.
246,So I’ve not seen any concrete proposals along this line.,CHAIR YELLEN.
247,I don’t really know what a “21st century Glass-Steagall” would look like.,CHAIR YELLEN.
248,I think my reading on the financial crisis is that that wasn’t the major source of the financial crisis.,CHAIR YELLEN.
249,"In fact, many of the problems emanated from firms that were investment banking units.",CHAIR YELLEN.
250,"To me, an important reform in the aftermath of the crisis was to make sure that investment banking activities where—that were a core part of the shadow banking system where leverage had built—that those were appropriately capitalized, had appropriate liquidity, and their management was strengthened, and that’s what we have tried to do.",CHAIR YELLEN.
251,"But, obviously, we would look at any proposals that are put forward.",CHAIR YELLEN.
252,I’m not aware of anything concrete to react to.,CHAIR YELLEN.
253,So—so you don’t think it’s necessarily [inaudible] a really good idea?,JOHN HELTMAN.
254,"Well, I don’t think it was the cause of the financial crisis, and I do feel that we have significantly strengthened supervision of bank holding companies that incorporate investment banking activities.",CHAIR YELLEN.
255,"know, what message are you trying to send consumers with this particular rate hike?",CHAIR YELLEN.
256,I think that’s a great question.,CHAIR YELLEN.
257,I appreciate your asking it.,CHAIR YELLEN.
258,"And the simple message is, the economy is doing well.",CHAIR YELLEN.
259,We have confidence in the robustness of the economy and its resilience to shocks.,CHAIR YELLEN.
260,It’s performed well over the last several years.,CHAIR YELLEN.
261,"We have created, since the trough in employment after the financial crisis, around 16 million jobs.",CHAIR YELLEN.
262,"The unemployment rate has moved way down, and many more people feel optimistic about their prospects in the labor market.",CHAIR YELLEN.
263,There is job security.,CHAIR YELLEN.
264,"We’re seeing more people who are feeling free to quit their jobs, getting outside offers, looking for other opportunities.",CHAIR YELLEN.
265,"So I think the job market, which is an important focus for us, is certainly improving.",CHAIR YELLEN.
266,That’s not to say that it’s a—good labor market conditions for every individual in the United States.,CHAIR YELLEN.
267,"We know there are problems that face, particularly, people with less skill and education and in certain sectors of the economy, but many Americans are enjoying a stronger labor market and feel better—feel very much better about that.",CHAIR YELLEN.
268,"And inflation is moving—moving up, I think, toward our 2 percent objective.",CHAIR YELLEN.
269,And we’re operating in an environment where the U.S. economy is performing well and risks seem pretty balanced.,CHAIR YELLEN.
270,So I think people can feel good about the economic outlook.,CHAIR YELLEN.
271,"Hi, Jeanna Smialek, Bloomberg News.",JEANNA SMIALEK.
272,"You emphasized in the statement that the Fed’s inflation target is “symmetric.”  Would you be able to expand a little bit on why you did that, why it was included, how much of an overshoot would the Fed be willing to tolerate, and for how long?",JEANNA SMIALEK.
273,"Well, a couple of years ago, we included the word “symmetric” in our statement of longer-run goals, and this seemed like an appropriate time to introduce that inflation from our 2 percent objective.",CHAIR YELLEN.
274,"Now, headline inflation has moved almost back up to 2 percent.",CHAIR YELLEN.
275,"As I indicated, a better forward-looking measure of inflation, core inflation—that’s not our target, but I think it’s worth looking at because it’s a better forward-looking predictor of headline inflation—I think that’s still running a little bit under 2 percent, but we expect it’s going to move up to 2.",CHAIR YELLEN.
276,And this seemed like a good time to remind Americans that what our objective is is 2 percent inflation.,CHAIR YELLEN.
277,Inflation is not always going to be at 2 percent.,CHAIR YELLEN.
278,"It’s—like all economic variables, it fluctuates.",CHAIR YELLEN.
279,"Sometimes it’s going to be below 2 percent, sometimes it’s going to be above 2 percent.",CHAIR YELLEN.
280,We’ve had a long period in which inflation has run under 2 percent.,CHAIR YELLEN.
281,"As we move back to 2 percent, which is where we’re heading, there will be some times when it’s above 2 percent as well.",CHAIR YELLEN.
282,"And it’s a reminder—2 percent is not a ceiling on inflation, it’s a target.",CHAIR YELLEN.
283,It’s where we always want inflation to be heading.,CHAIR YELLEN.
284,"And there will be some times when inflation is above 2 percent, just like it’s been below 2 percent.",CHAIR YELLEN.
285,"We’re not shooting for inflation above 2 percent, but it’s a reminder that there will be deviations above and below when we’re achieving our objective.",CHAIR YELLEN.
286,How well can you tolerate an overshoot?,JEANNA SMIALEK.
287,"Well, we would—if there were an overshoot and it appeared to be persistent, we would put in place policies to try to bring inflation back to 2 percent.",CHAIR YELLEN.
288,That’s the core set of principles that we have adopted in our statement on longer-run goals and strategy.,CHAIR YELLEN.
289,"And exactly how long it would take to get back to 2 percent would depend, in part, on what was happening with respect to employment and our other objectives.",CHAIR YELLEN.
290,So there’s no hard and fast answer to that.,CHAIR YELLEN.
291,"proposals, such as the border adjustment tax, would cause the dollar to strengthen significantly over a short period of time.",CHAIR YELLEN.
292,"I realize you can’t comment on the specific policy proposal, but if the dollar were to strengthen quickly over a short period of time, perhaps some 20 percent for whatever reason, what would—what do you think the impact would be on the U.S. economy, particularly in exports and manufacturing?",CHAIR YELLEN.
293,And what do you think would be any implications for U.S. monetary policy?,CHAIR YELLEN.
294,So that’s a—that’s a difficult question to answer.,CHAIR YELLEN.
295,You asked that question not in an isolated way:  What would the impact of a large appreciation of the dollar be?,CHAIR YELLEN.
296,"But, as I understand it, you asked about it in the context of a border tax adjustment.",CHAIR YELLEN.
297,Is that right?,CHAIR YELLEN.
298,Because the argument that is made is that what a border tax would do without an exchange rate adjustment is to raise the price of imported goods into the United States.,CHAIR YELLEN.
299,"And that large movement in the dollar that analysts claim would occur would essentially—if it were complete, would fully offset the impact of the border tax on U.S. import goods.",CHAIR YELLEN.
300,"So, it wouldn’t end up having an impact on U.S. inflation or GDP growth.",CHAIR YELLEN.
301,"But a question that’s a very different—that’s a very different matter than if, suddenly, for some reason, the dollar were simply to begin appreciating by a large amount, say, because there were flight-to-safety flows into the dollar.",CHAIR YELLEN.
302,"I mean, if—if the latter were to occur, there were just a big boost in the dollar, it would tend to put downward pressure on inflation and would have a negative effect on U.S. export growth and tend to boost imports.",CHAIR YELLEN.
303,"But that’s a, that’s a different—that’s a different exercise.",CHAIR YELLEN.
304,"I would just say, it’s very uncertain exactly what would happen to the dollar.",CHAIR YELLEN.
305,"There has been a lot of discussion of that, and I think it’s complicated and uncertain.",CHAIR YELLEN.
306,about Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee wrote to you asking that the Fed not put forward any regulations until a Vice Chair of Supervision is in place.,CHAIR YELLEN.
307,So I have a couple of questions about that.,CHAIR YELLEN.
308,"One is, are you all pulling back at all on any regulations—maybe not all regulations, but, you know, maybe only going forward with ones that you see as more time sensitive?",CHAIR YELLEN.
309,"And during the hearing before that committee, you mentioned specifically the CCAR stress-test rule would have to come out sometime before that next cycle.",CHAIR YELLEN.
310,Are there any other time-sensitive regulations?,CHAIR YELLEN.
311,So at this point we don’t have a lot of time-sensitive regulations.,CHAIR YELLEN.
312,There is nothing right now that we need to get out that’s a significant rule.,CHAIR YELLEN.
313,So we have a relatively light regulatory agenda at this point.,CHAIR YELLEN.
314,"We recognize, of course, that we do have an obligation to write the rules that Congress, you know, dictates in laws that they pass, and so that is an ongoing obligation—obligation that we have.",CHAIR YELLEN.
315,But our calendar is relatively light at this point.,CHAIR YELLEN.
316,I’m Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
317,Back here.,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
318,Yes.,CHAIR YELLEN.
319,Some Fed critics have said it’s too soon to raise interest rates because wages haven’t risen enough to justify a rate increase.,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
320,What would you say to that?,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
321,"Well, I don’t—I would like to see wages increase and think there’s some scope for them to increase somewhat further.",CHAIR YELLEN.
322,"But our objectives are maximum employment and inflation, and we need to consider what path of rates is appropriate to foster very slow productivity growth.",CHAIR YELLEN.
323,And I think we are seeing some upward pressure as the labor market tightens.,CHAIR YELLEN.
324,I take that as a signal that we’re coming closer to our maximum employment objectives.,CHAIR YELLEN.
325,"But productivity is—for those focusing on wage growth, productivity is an additional important factor.",CHAIR YELLEN.
