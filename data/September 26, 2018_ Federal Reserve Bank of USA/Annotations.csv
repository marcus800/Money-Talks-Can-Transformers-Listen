0,"September 26, 2018  CHAIRMAN POWELL: Good afternoon, everyone.",None
1,Thanks for being here.,None
2,"I am going to start with an overview of how my colleagues and I see the economy, what we decided today, and then a bit about our expectations for the months ahead.",None
3,Our economy is strong.,None
4,Growth is running at a healthy clip.,None
5,"Unemployment is low, the number of people working is rising steadily, and wages are up.",None
6,Inflation is low and stable.,None
7,All of these are very good signs.,None
8,"Of course, that’s not to say that everything is perfect.",None
9,The benefits of this strong economy have not reached all Americans.,None
10,"Many of our country’s economic challenges are beyond the scope of the Fed, but my colleagues and I are doing all we can to keep the economy strong, healthy, and moving forward.",None
11,That is the best way we can promote an environment in which every American has the opportunity to succeed.,None
12,"Each time my colleagues and I meet, we face the same question: How can we set policy to best support job growth and low, steady inflation?",None
13,"For many years, this question called for very low interest rates to help an economy that had been damaged by the deep financial crisis that gripped the world 10 years ago.",None
14,"As the economy has steadily gained strength, the Fed has been gradually returning interest rates closer to levels that are normal in a healthy economy.",None
15,We  took another step on that path today with a quarter-point increase in short-term  interest rates.,None
16,"These rates remain low, and my colleagues and I believe that this gradual return to normal is helping to sustain this strong economy for the longer-run benefit of all Americans.",None
17,"As I mentioned, 10 years have now passed since the depths of the financial crisis—a painful part of our history that cost many Americans their jobs, their homes, and, for some, their hopes and dreams.",None
18,"In addition to holding interest rates low to support the recovery, we have also banks to much higher standards in the amount of capital and liquidity they hold and in the ways they assess and manage the risks they take.",None
19,I am  confident that the system today is stronger and in a far better position to support the financial needs of households and businesses through good times and bad.,None
20,We continue to work to sustain these fundamental improvements while also ensuring that regulation is both effective and efficient.,None
21,"Now, let me go into more detail about the developments that motivated today’s policy decision.",None
22,"Both household spending and business investment are expanding briskly, and the overall growth outlook remains favorable.",None
23,"And several factors support this assessment:  Fiscal policy is boosting the economy, ongoing job gains are raising incomes and confidence, and overall financial conditions remain accommodative.",None
24,These conditions are consistent with our Summary of Economic Projections for this meeting.,None
25,The median of  Committee participants’ projections for the growth of real GDP is 3.1 percent this year and 2.5 percent next year.,None
26,"Job gains averaged 185,000 per month over the last three months, well above the pace needed in the longer run to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force.",None
27,The unemployment rate stood at 3.9 percent in August and has been near that level since April.,None
28,"Smoothing through month-to-month variations, the labor force participation rate remains about where it was in late 2013—a positive sign, given that the aging of our population is putting downward pressure on participation.",None
29,We expect the job market to remain strong.,None
30,And the median of Committee participants’ projections for the unemployment rate later this year is 3.7 percent and a bit lower than that in 2019.,None
31,"Overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE inflation), increased 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in July.",None
32,"The core future inflation, rose 2 percent over the same period.",None
33,"The FOMC seeks, and expects to see, inflation remaining near our 2 percent longer-run objective on a sustained basis.",None
34,"At any given time, inflation may be somewhat above or below 2 percent.",None
35,"For example, the recent rise in oil prices has pushed inflation a little above 2 percent, but we expect this to be transitory, as is reflected in our projections.",None
36,The median projections for both the overall and core inflation measures remain very close to 2 percent across the whole projection horizon.,None
37,"Today the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing it to 2 to 2¼ percent.",None
38,This action reflects the strength we see in the economy and is one more step in the process that we began almost three years ago of gradually returning interest rates to more normal levels.,None
39,"Looking ahead, today’s projections show gradual interest rate increases continuing roughly as foreseen in June.",None
40,The median of participants’ views on appropriate policy through 2020 are unchanged since the June meeting.,None
41,These projections play an important role in our work.,None
42,My colleagues and I believe that it’s useful to communicate our views on likely prospects for the economy and for policy.,None
43,"We are well aware, however, that the economy regularly surprises, and that even the most carefully constructed projections are highly uncertain.",None
44,"The projections about the appropriate path of policy assume that the economy evolves broadly in line with the projections for growth, employment, unemployment, and inflation.",None
45,"If the economy were instead to falter, lower interest rates would be appropriate.",None
46,"Conversely, if inflationary pressures were to rise more than expected, higher interest rates would be appropriate.",None
47,"Right now, as our statement indicates, risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.",None
48,"Readers of the FOMC statement likely noted that the Committee dropped a sentence that signal any change in the likely path of policy; instead, it is a sign that policy is proceeding in line with our expectations.",None
49,"We still expect, as our statement says, “further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate,” and this expectation is reflected in the projections that I just discussed.",None
50,Thanks very much.,None
51,I’m happy to take your questions.,None
52,Thank you.,NICK TIMIRAOS.
53,"Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal.",NICK TIMIRAOS.
54,"Chair Powell, given the lags of monetary policy, I want to know how you think about ending the tightening cycle?",NICK TIMIRAOS.
55,How will you know when to stop?,NICK TIMIRAOS.
56,And do you need to keep going until something in the economy breaks?,NICK TIMIRAOS.
57,"So the tightening cycle, as you know, is a reflection of the strength of the economy.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
58,And it’s almost three years now that we’ve been gradually raising rates.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
59,"And I think the fact that we have moved quite gradually, in a way, allows us to carefully watch incoming data in the real economy and in the financial markets to see how the economy is processing higher interest rates.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
60,"And the fact that we’re moving so gradually—I think it—I think it limits the long and variable lags problem because, you know, we’re being able to raise rates and then wait and see how the economy absorbs these rate increases.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
61,"And so far, the economy has performed very well and very much in keeping with our expectations.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
62,"Hi, Jim Puzzanghera from the L.A. Times.",JIM PUZZANGHERA.
63,President Trump has stated publicly he’s not thrilled with the interest rate hikes.,JIM PUZZANGHERA.
64,His comments didn’t appear to have any impact on you or your colleagues.,JIM PUZZANGHERA.
65,Were his comments discussed at your meeting?,JIM PUZZANGHERA.
66,And do you have any concerns about the effect of these types of comments on the perception of the Fed’s independence and your monetary policy?,JIM PUZZANGHERA.
67,So we’ve been given a really important job to do on behalf of and I are focused exclusively on carrying out that mission.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
68,"We consider the best thinking, the best theory, and the best evidence.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
69,"We have disparate points of view, which we debate extensively and come to a perspective and try to set monetary policy to achieve maximum  employment in a context of price stability.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
70,That’s what we do.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
71,We don’t consider political factors or things like that.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
72,"And so that’s who we are, that’s what we do, and that’s just the way it’s always going to be for us.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
73,"Steve Liesman, CNBC.",STEVE LIESMAN.
74,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",STEVE LIESMAN.
75,"Can you explain how—the stock market being at a near all-time high, corporate spreads being very tight—how does the level of the market factor into your decisions to raise interest rates?",STEVE LIESMAN.
76,Is there a concern on your part?,STEVE LIESMAN.
77,"And then, as sort of a second and related part, can you tell us what happens in 2020 and 2021 that—I know you can’t tell us when you’re shaking your head [laughter]—that prompts—that prompts you—the Fed to think that the rates need to still be  above neutral in that time period?",STEVE LIESMAN.
78,Thank you.,STEVE LIESMAN.
79,Sure.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
80,"So in terms of financial markets and monetary policy, we—as we say in our statement every cycle, we do take financial conditions into consideration because financial—broader financial conditions do affect the broader economy, and they’re one of the many things that we take into account.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
81,"The part of it that we control, though, is what we do with the federal funds rate and that has—that has effects out through, you know, out through the full interest rate curve and into financial asset prices generally.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
82,"So the answer is, we take everything into account, but, you know, broader financial conditions are just one of the things that we take into account.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
83,"In terms of ’20 and ’21, why—your question was why the funds rate needs to be above overshoots of their personal estimates of neutral a couple—three years out.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
84,"You know, it’s far out into the future.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
85,I think it’s hard to be confident that that’s—that that’s the way things are going to be.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
86,What we’re going to be doing as we—as we go through time is asking at every meeting whether monetary policy is set to achieve our goals.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
87,"And I think that that’s an assessment of where policy will need to be some years down the road, and I’ll leave it at that.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
88,Thanks.,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
89,Howard Schneider with Reuters.,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
90,"Chair Powell, I think—is this too good to be true?",HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
91,"Because you’ve got four years here of unemployment below 4 percent—very low, substantially below NAIRU, what appears to be NAIRU—but no reaction of inflation there.",HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
92,And so I don’t think that’s ever happened since the 1960s.,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
93,Why do you think it’s going to happen now?,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
94,"Or in the alternative, is this forecast for unemployment just being driven by your confidence intervals to the extent that, well, we don’t know what else to do, so just extend the lie out—line out until something happens?",HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
95,"No, you’re right.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
96,"The Committee forecasts what they—what they show, in general, is an economy where unemployment remains in the high and middle 3s throughout the entire forecast period and inflation remains very close to 2 percent.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
97,That is what the forecast shows.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
98,"And that is based on our understanding of the way the inflation process works now and on the fact that the inflation seems to be fairly nonreactive to changes in slack— that is to say, a flat Phillips curve.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
99,And it’s just—it’s a—it’s a world of strongly anchored inflation expectations.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
100,"And that’s not just our forecast, that’s many forecasts.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
101,So that is—that is —that is the forecast.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
102,"So you may ask—I mean, the sense is,  what does the longer-run natural rate of unemployment mean?",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
103,And so that really is a longer-run concept that we think  the economy will return to over the longer run.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
104,"But, obviously, that longer run, you know, isn’t— Now let’s just admit that the inflation process has changed dramatically from  where it was in the 1960s to where it is now.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
105,It’s in a good place now.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
106,"We can’t take for granted that it will remain the way it is, and, you know, we will be, of course, watching carefully.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
107,"If inflation reacts more strongly or more weakly to the strong economy, then we’ll adjust policy appropriately.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
108,"If I could follow up on that, what are you buying with interest rates?",HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
109,"Well, interest rates, of course, have effects on growth, have effects—I mean if—I guess the—your question was, what are you buying with by raising interest rates?",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
110,"The question is, what would the economy look like if you didn’t raise rates?",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
111,"It would look very different, I think, if we didn’t raise rates.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
112,"We’re always trying to, you know, work our way between the—sort of the two—the two problems we face.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
113,"One is that if we move too quickly, we can, you know, snuff out a recovery unnecessarily, and inflation falls short of its 2 percent target.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
114,"Or if we move too slowly, we have an economy that can overheat.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
115,So we’re—that—that’s happened through history.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
116,"We don’t see any signs of that now, but we’re always trying to navigate between those two shoals.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
117,"And we think that gradually, you know, raising interest rates is the way that we kind of take both of those risks seriously.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
118,Thanks very much.,SAM FLEMING.
119,Sam Fleming from  the Financial Times.,SAM FLEMING.
120,The Fed has recently been saying that financial stability risks are moderate.,SAM FLEMING.
121,What kind of developments could prompt a change in that assessment to elevated risks?,SAM FLEMING.
122,"And is there an argument for moving the countercyclical capital buffer, even when risks are moderate, rather than waiting CHAIRMAN POWELL.",SAM FLEMING.
123,So I think one of the most important lessons from the financial crisis is really the importance of the stability of the financial system.,SAM FLEMING.
124,"And so we—since the financial crisis, as you’re aware, we’ve had a major focus on building up our monitoring of financial conditions and financial stability issues.",SAM FLEMING.
125,"We’ve also put in place many, many initiatives to strengthen the financial system  through higher capital and better regulation, more transparency, central clearing, margins on uncleared derivatives, all kinds of things like that, which are meant to strengthen the financial system.",SAM FLEMING.
126,"We’ve done many of those things, and we feel that the financial system is in a much better place.",SAM FLEMING.
127,"As we look at—as we look at conditions most recently—and this was at our last meeting, and it was in our minutes for the last meeting—quarterly, we have a briefing at the FOMC, and also at the Board, of the staffs’ views on financial stability, and the staff judged the overall vulnerabilities to be moderate.",SAM FLEMING.
128,"If you dig into the different aspects of that question, households or balance sheets are in good shape.",SAM FLEMING.
129,"You know, employment is high, wages are rising, that sort of thing.",SAM FLEMING.
130,"The banking system, as I mentioned, is—you know, much higher capital, much higher liquidity—is much stronger.",SAM FLEMING.
131,"If you look at asset prices, it is true that some asset prices are in the upper range of their historical—upper reach of their historical ranges.",SAM FLEMING.
132,"And then if you look at nonfinancial corporates, you get—there is the story of leverage there.",SAM FLEMING.
133,"So it’s not that there aren’t any vulnerabilities, but we see them as moderate.",SAM FLEMING.
134,"Now, you ask about the countercyclical capital buffer.",SAM FLEMING.
135,"The countercyclical capital buffer is a tool that we added to our toolkit, I think, finally, back in 2016.",SAM FLEMING.
136,We said that we would deploy it when vulnerabilities were meaningfully above normal.,SAM FLEMING.
137,"We revisit that on a regular schedule, and the last time we revisited it was, I think, last year—sometime last year—and assessment was that vulnerabilities were moderate, but it remains a kit—a tool for our toolkit that we can deploy, you know, when and as we feel appropriate.",SAM FLEMING.
138,Has the chance of needing to deploy it increased?,SAM FLEMING.
139,"As I said, I think I’m in the camp of seeing vulnerabilities as relatively moderate.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
140,I think the financial system—I think another thing that we learned in the crisis is that we need to be alert to the buildup of vulnerabilities as a long expansion continues.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
141,"I don’t see that in troubling—troubling amounts at this point, but, you know, I think it’s appropriate for us to monitor that very carefully.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
142,"Marty Crutsinger, Associated Press.",MARTY CRUTSINGER.
143,"The researchers at the European Central Bank this week put out a paper saying that the impact of a trade war on the U.S. could be dire, that the U.S. economy could drop by 2 percent in the first year after a widespread trade war.",MARTY CRUTSINGER.
144,"Could you talk about the discussion you’ve had—your policy statement, does it mention the trade tensions?",MARTY CRUTSINGER.
145,You did not mention them.,MARTY CRUTSINGER.
146,What do you—what kind of outlook do you have right now for the trade war?,MARTY CRUTSINGER.
147,Sure.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
148,"So I guess I need to start by saying that we’re not responsible for trade policy, and we don’t comment on particular, you know, trade actions and that sort of thing.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
149,"But you will have seen that we have this very extensive network of business contacts around the country through the Reserve Banks largely, and we’ve been hearing a rising chorus of concerns from  businesses all over the country about disruption of supply chains, materials costs and increases, and loss of markets, and things like that.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
150,"So we’ve been hearing quite a lot of that, and we—the Reserve Bank presidents talk about it in the meeting, and it goes in the minutes.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
151,"So we, you know, that’s—we’re very transparent about hearing all that.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
152,"I think a national level, it’s hard to see much happening at this point.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
153,"And—or you can look at it the other way:  You can ask, if all of the tariffs that have been announced are applied, what would be the effect at the aggregate level?",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
154,And they’re still relatively small.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
155,"You know, we worry about a couple of things.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
156,"One is loss of business confidence, which could reduce investment.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
157,"Again, we don’t really see effects that we could measure yet.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
158,"Also, the possibility of a financial market reaction over time to unexpected trade developments.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
159,"More than anything, though, I would worry, in the longer run, where this is going, you know.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
160,"If the— if the end place we get to is lower tariffs, that would be good, you know.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
161,"Trade generally supports productivity, supports higher incomes.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
162,"And, you know, fair trade—fair trade under internationally accepted rules can be a good thing.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
163,"I think if this, perhaps inadvertently, goes to a place where we have widespread tariffs that remain in place for a long time—a more protectionist world—that’s going to be bad for the United States’ economy and for American workers, and families, and also for other economies.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
164,"Hi, Heather Long from  the Washington Post.",HEATHER LONG.
165,This is the third time this year that the FOMC has raised its growth forecasts.,HEATHER LONG.
166,I’m wondering if you could share a little bit about what’s causing that rise and whether you see supply-side effects coming through from  the fiscal policy—fiscal stimulus yet.,HEATHER LONG.
167,Thanks.,HEATHER LONG.
168,So it’s true.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
169,This year has—we’ve kept raising our forecast for this year.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
170,"This—as the year’s gone on, the economy has come in stronger than we expected, and that’s a really good thing.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
171,"And the economy, as I mentioned at the beginning, is strong, and there’s good reason to expect that to continue.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
172,You ask why.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
173,"You know, some of it is, no doubt, the effect of the fiscal policy changes, the tax cuts, and the spending increases—that’s got to be oil patch.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
174,"But, you know, the growth picture is very much supported by very high readings of household confidence, business confidence, so it’s a—it’s a—it’s a—it’s a pretty particularly bright moment, I think.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
175,"If you look back over the last decade, this is a pretty good moment for the U.S. economy.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
176,And the supply-side effects?,HEATHER LONG.
177,"Oh, supply-side effects, yeah.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
178,"So, you know, we hope they’re huge, frankly.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
179,"You know, the idea is, you cut—you reduce taxation on corporations and particularly—and allow  faster expensing for investment.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
180,"The idea is to encourage more investment, and that is one of the things that drives productivity, which is one of the main things that drives rising incomes.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
181,"So the effects are very uncertain, they’re—you know, they’re—the literature is—it’s—there’s no clear answer to exactly how these mechanisms work or how effective they are.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
182,And it would be soon to be seeing supply-side effects.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
183,The other—supply-side effects are probably both more uncertain and they’re probably slower to come in.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
184,"But, you know, as I said, we—I certainly hope—I hope that we’ll be marking up our estimates of potential growth as well.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
185,Craig Torres from Bloomberg News.,CRAIG TORRES.
186,"Taking a page from your risk-management approach in Jackson Hole, Mr. Chairman, I’m wondering if you can talk about what risks would make the Committee—plausible risks—go faster in 2019.",CRAIG TORRES.
187,What risks would make them go slower?,CRAIG TORRES.
188,If you could talk about scenarios.,CRAIG TORRES.
189,"And then I’d like to ask, do you see yourself, as this stimulus tails off, which it does in the forecast, possibly cutting rates to soft-land the economy?",CRAIG TORRES.
190,"I know the forecast doesn’t show that, but I’m curious how you soft-land without CHAIRMAN POWELL.",CRAIG TORRES.
191,"Okay, so I think I mentioned in the opening remarks maybe something that addressed your question about what would make us go faster and slower.",CRAIG TORRES.
192,"You know, the main thing where we might need to move along a little bit quicker would be if inflation—inflation surprises to the upside.",CRAIG TORRES.
193,We don’t see that.,CRAIG TORRES.
194,We really don’t see that.,CRAIG TORRES.
195,"It’s not in our forecast, but any—so I would—I regard that as a risk.",CRAIG TORRES.
196,I think either a significant— significant—correction and lasting correction in financial markets or a slowing down in the economy that’s inconsistent with our forecast—those are the kinds of things we’d react to.,CRAIG TORRES.
197,"In terms of what, you know, what we would do—you know, I think we’re always going to be adjusting monetary policy to—in light of conditions on the ground.",CRAIG TORRES.
198,"So if the economy is weakening, then it’s very possible we’d be—we’d be cutting rates and, you know, vice versa.",CRAIG TORRES.
199,And so I can’t rule that out.,CRAIG TORRES.
200,"It—I think it’s quite difficult, though, to know what the effects— what the sort of end effects of fiscal policy are going to be in 2020.",CRAIG TORRES.
201,"It’s difficult to know what the policy will be, let alone what their effects will be that far out.",CRAIG TORRES.
202,"So we have to make estimates, but we know that they’re highly uncertain.",CRAIG TORRES.
203,Edward Lawrence from  Fox Business.,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
204,"Thank you, Chairman.",EDWARD LAWRENCE.
205,The unemployment rate is now at 3.9 percent.,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
206,The average hourly wages rose 2.9 percent for the past 12 months.,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
207,"Inflation, according  to your numbers, holding steady.",EDWARD LAWRENCE.
208,"The amount of job vacancies that we have out there and the number of people coming back into the workforce this year—where is the point at which, then, we are actually above the natural rate of unemployment  and the Federal Reserve should reexamine the consistency of the rate hikes going forward so not to cool an expanding economy?",EDWARD LAWRENCE.
209,"You mean—you mean, where’s the point at which inflation— force participation has surprised us on the upside.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
210,"There is a long-run trend there, and we’ve now had basically five flat years.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
211,"If you look—if you look at labor force participation, since the fourth quarter of ’13 till now, you really have a—kind of an oscillation that basically is a sideways movement in the face of a significant downward trend, thanks to aging and other factors.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
212,"That’s a gain of well more than a percentage point in participation, so that’s really— that’s really a good thing.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
213,"Those are people who are remaining in contact with the labor force and looking for jobs, finding jobs.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
214,So that’s a great thing.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
215,"And, by the way, it’s a signal.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
216,It’s one of the things that has allowed the unemployment rate not to fall further.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
217,"And it’s a—it’s a signal, too, that there may be more there on the supply side, that there may be more labor supply than the prior trend would indicate.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
218,So it’s a very positive thing to see people staying in the labor force.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
219,"And, you know, we don’t know how long it can continue.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
220,"We have models, and we look at this—we look at this question all the  time.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
221,"And, you know, admittedly, we’ve been surprised on the positive side here, so we’re open to the idea that that may continue or not.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
222,"Hi, Chair.",DONNA BORAK.
223,Donna Borak with CNN.,DONNA BORAK.
224,"Just to follow up on the tariff question, you said earlier that it seems as the effects of the tariff so far haven’t quite materialized—those weren’t your words verbat[im]—but Wal-Mart, Gap, Coca-Cola, General Motors, Macy’s have all said that they expect the tariffs to affect the prices of everyday consumer goods.",DONNA BORAK.
225,"So my question is, when—should there be an effect—when would you expect to see that?",DONNA BORAK.
226,And at what point do you start to become worried that it’s actually going to affect consumer spending and dampening economic growth?,DONNA BORAK.
227,It’s a concern.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
228,It’s a risk.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
229,"You know, so you could see prices might provide a basis for companies to raise prices in a world where they’ve been very reluctant to and unable to raise prices, where raising prices is really difficult, you know, with the ability to shop on the internet.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
230,"This could provide, you know, a way for—again, we don’t see it in the numbers.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
231,"And, you know, until we see it in the numbers, it’s hard to say how one would react.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
232,"And the other question would be, if you’re just talking about the effect on inflation is, is it just a one-time increase in the price level, or is it actually fueling higher inflation going forward?",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
233,"And that’s a real—that’s an important question in, in how we would think about the appropriate response.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
234,"But is there a sense of timing, in terms of when you might see that kick in, the effect of?",DONNA BORAK.
235,Don’t see it yet.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
236,"You know, don’t see it yet, but we—you’re hearing—I mean, broadly across the economy, it’s not just tariffs.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
237,"You’re hearing—we’re hearing a lot of talk of labor shortages, of material costs in particular industries.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
238,"We’re hearing a lot, you know, what amount to supply-side constraints and things like that, but we’re not seeing it.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
239,"We’re seeing a sort of modest increase in wages, inflation right around 2 percent, no sense of it moving up really, so we’re not seeing it yet.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
240,"And, you know, we just aren’t, and we’re watching very carefully.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
241,"Mr. Chairman, Michael McKee, Bloomberg Radio and Television.",MICHAEL MCKEE.
242,Financial conditions are still extremely loose by all the measures that track that.,MICHAEL MCKEE.
243,The flow of funds shows the decline in short-term borrowing other than in Treasuries.,MICHAEL MCKEE.
244,So I’m wondering if that suggests a change in the way that tightening  affects the economy.,MICHAEL MCKEE.
245,"And along those lines, you mentioned that you dropped the word “accommodative” doesn’t suggest a change in policy.",MICHAEL MCKEE.
246,"serve any purpose anymore if, as you say, you can’t be confident out to 2021 what’s going to happen with the economy?",MICHAEL MCKEE.
247,A couple questions in there.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
248,"So the dot plot—I mean, I—it’s not new.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
249,I don’t think it’s a new point that forecasts two and three out—two or three years out are fairly uncertain.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
250,The dot plot is individual FOMC participants who are writing down their individual views on the evolution of the economy and of appropriate monetary policy.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
251,We don’t vote on that.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
252,These are individual forecasts.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
253,"I think market participants generally find  that interesting information, and so it seems to me to be serving a purpose.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
254,I think the point with “accommodative” was that its useful life was over.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
255,"You know, we put that in the statement in 2015, just when we lifted off, and the idea was to provide assurance that we weren’t trying to slow down the economy, but, in fact, we were still—interest rates were still going to be pushing to support economic activity.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
256,"Well, that—you know, that purpose has been well served, and the language now doesn’t really say anything that’s important to the way the Committee is thinking about policy going forward.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
257,That’s why that came out.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
258,Did I get— did I get all of your ques—?,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
259,The idea that financial conditions remain loose even though you raised rates 200 basis points?,MICHAEL MCKEE.
260,"Yeah, you know, it’s—if you look at a broad financial conditions index, that’s pretty much the answer you’ll get.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
261,"We don’t control that, and, as I mentioned earlier, we do take financial conditions into account in what we do.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
262,"And financial conditions are affecting the broader economy, so, by definition, we’re taking them  into account.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
263,"But if you look at—look at interest rates, you know, interest rates—look at long-term interest know, with your long and variable lags, that should be—that should be having an effect over time.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
264,"Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico.",VICTORIA GUIDA.
265,"So Nellie Liang was just put forward by President Donald Trump to the Fed Board, and I was just curious, you know, given that she’s a longtime veteran of the Fed, whether you could speak to what role you played in, you know, recommending candidates to the President, giving input on who he should nominate.",VICTORIA GUIDA.
266,"And then also, if I—if I may follow up on the financial stability discussion from earlier, you know, you’ve mentioned before that corporate debt is at high levels, and I was curious whether, you know, you have any qualms about loosening up restrictions on leveraged lending by making that guidance less of a—less of a cudgel, I guess, while—at a time when leveraged lending is gaining steam?",VICTORIA GUIDA.
267,"Okay, so in terms of nominations to the Fed, those are entirely, completely under the control of the White House and, ultimately, the President.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
268,"And traditionally, the Fed Chair has been consulted on those, and I’m happy to say that that has continued.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
269,"But these are—these are really decisions for the White House, and, you know, we are—think of us as just being consulted.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
270,"I will say that I’m very happy and excited about the team that we’re putting together, and I’m very much looking forward to having those offices up and down our hall filled.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
271,"It’s been pretty quiet, more quieter than usual, which is saying something on the Board hall.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
272,So we’re looking forward to getting some people confirmed.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
273,"In terms of corporate debt, so this is a—this is a—you know, I was an investor for a long time in areas that were very close to the leveraged lending markets.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
274,"So, you know, I have had a lot of experience in that.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
275,That market has evolved really significantly since before the crisis.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
276,"essentially in the business of distributing these loans and bonds rather than keeping them on their balance sheet, to a much greater degree.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
277,"But it’s also true—and there’s significant research on this—that excessive risk-taking in the leveraged lending markets does have channels for affecting the real economy, if there’s overheating and that kind of thing in those markets, so we monitor that carefully.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
278,"You know, the guidance is—isn’t binding, as you pointed out, that the leveraged lending isn’t binding, and that’s just—that’s just the way that the law is interpreted.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
279,"So it’s something we’re monitoring, and, as I mentioned, we think overall vulnerabilities are moderate.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
280,"Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times.",BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.
281,"If I could come back to “accommodative,” do you think of policy as accommodative at present?",BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.
282,"How close are you to neutrality, and do you share the view of some of your colleagues that you’ll eventually need to be restrictive?",BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.
283,"Okay, so are we accommodative now?",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
284,"So I think if you look at the—look at the dot plot in the SEP, you’ll see that the federal funds rate, even after today’s move, is below the longer-run neutral estimate of every single participant that—who submits a— an estimate of that.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
285,"So that’s why this is the perfect time to take the language out, because, you know, it’s perfectly clear that there can’t be a signal because, you know, by definition, that means an accommodative policy.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
286,So  it wasn’t because policy  is not accommodative.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
287,It is still accommodative.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
288,"The thinking was more, as I mentioned, it’s more that the language has run its useful life.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
289,"There’s another point, though, too, which is, you know, we don’t want to suggest either that we have this precise understanding of where “accommodative” stops or suggest that that’s a stay on this path, is, we’re going to be carefully monitoring incoming data from  the financial markets and from  the economy and asking ourselves whether our policy is achieving the goals we want to achieve—you know, sustain the economy, maximum employment, stable prices.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
290,"That’s the way we’re thinking about it, and that does kind of amount to thinking less about one’s precise point estimate of the neutral rate.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
291,So that’s how I think about that.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
292,"The second question was, do you think you’re going to end up in a restrictive posture?",BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.
293,"Governor Brainard, for example, has said that she expects that you will need to do that.",BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.
294,Do you agree with that?,BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.
295,It’s possible.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
296,It’s very possible.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
297,It happens often.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
298,"And, as I mentioned, many of the participants have written that down, and they’ve written down really modest overshoots, you know, amounting to one rate hike kind of thing, which wouldn’t have a big effect on the economy.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
299,"You know, it—I would just say, you know, it really depends on what happens.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
300,It depends on if we keep going—you can think of it different ways.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
301,Maybe we’ve underestimated the neutral rate.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
302,"Maybe we’ll be raising our estimate of the neutral rate and we’ll just go to that, or maybe we’ll keep our neutral rate here and then go one or two rate increases beyond it.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
303,"I think it’s very possible, but I mean, ultimately, isn’t really the question we’re answering.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
304,"The question we’re answering is, how do we provide the economy just the right amount of support— not too much, not too little—to sustain the recovery and achieve our statutory goals?",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
305,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",GREG ROBB.
306,Greg Robb from  MarketWatch.,GREG ROBB.
307,The 10-year anniversary of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers got a lot of attention over the last month.,GREG ROBB.
308,I was wondering if you thought there were any lessons from  the crisis that you want to share—and Paulson and Mr. Geithner and Chair Bernanke have said that Congress made a mistake when it took away the Fed’s emergency powers in Dodd-Frank.,GREG ROBB.
309,"And then one other thing is that, are you confident that all these nonbanks didn’t—you know, nonbanks never got put into the, you know, the FSOC, you know, system.",GREG ROBB.
310,So are you confident that the—you can see the risks in the financial system?,GREG ROBB.
311,Thank you.,GREG ROBB.
312,"So, three things there.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
313,"The first thing is the single biggest thing I think that we learned was the—as I mentioned, I think, earlier, the importance of maintaining the stability of the financial system.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
314,"So I think if you look—if you look back at the way the models worked and the way people thought about risk in the economy, that’s what was missing, and I think it’s not missing anymore.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
315,"So we—you know, we put a tremendous focus on that.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
316,"We raised capital, liquidity.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
317,"We have stress tests, which force banks to understand—the largest banks particularly—to understand and better manage their risk and have enough capital to survive a really substantial shock that’s at least as bad as the financial crisis.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
318,"And if all that doesn’t work, we’ve got resolution plans, which we’ve, you know, through many cycles, have made really substantial progress, more than I had thought was likely.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
319,So we’ve done a lot.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
320,"Nobody’s—you know, nobody is, I think, overconfident that we’ve solved every problem.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
321,"And, you know, now we’re going back and kind of taking a hard look at everything and, you know, trying to make—trying to—trying to keep at it.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
322,"So I think those are the really important lessons, and, you know, we—we’re determined not to, you know, not to forget them.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
323,"And that’s, I think, a risk now—is to—is to forget things that we—that we learned.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
324,That’s just human nature over time.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
325,"I saw the article you’re talking about; the question is, did Congress take things away, 13, section 13(3), to provide support to individual nonbanks, which is really holding companies and other companies.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
326,"In exchange for that, we got orderly liquidation authority and a resolution authority.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
327,Was it a mistake?,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
328,I don’t think there’s any sense that Congress would seriously look at changing that.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
329,I have real doubts about whether it was wise to take away our crisis-fighting tools.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
330,"I think you put them  away, and you hope you never need them, but—and I certainly strongly oppose efforts to take away more of our tools.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
331,"You know, the third thing you mentioned is the designation power.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
332,So it’s a really important power.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
333,"In my mind, it should be used—my thinking, it should be used sparingly, and that means, you know, in situations where you have—I mean, in principle, you could have another Lehman Brothers come up out of the ground that’s not a bank, and it could be very threatening—or it could be capable of creating systemic risk.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
334,And so I think it’s a critical power to have.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
335,"But, again, I would use it—I would tend to use it fairly sparingly.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
336,Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
337,Are you worried about the effect of rising interest rates on consumers?,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
338,Credit card rates have jumped to more than 17 percent since the Fed started raising interest rates.,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
339,Mortgage rates are up.,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
340,What do you say to consumers?,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
341,"Yeah, we look—of course, we look at that very carefully, and interest rates are going up across a broad range of consumer borrowing, as they would when we raise short-term interest rates.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
342,They’re still quite low by historical levels.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
343,"And the other thing I’ll say is, take—if you take housing, if you look at the NAR Affordability Index, housing is still more affordable now than it was before the financial crisis.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
344,So you’re right that the cost of something that we watch carefully.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
345,"You know, the effect on consumer spending is a very important channel through which interest rates work, and so we do monitor the effects.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
346,"Hi, Hannah Lang, American Banker.",HANNAH LANG.
347,OCC’s decision to go at CRA alone suggests that there’s some sort of disagreement among how to proceed with a joint plan.,HANNAH LANG.
348,"What are the issues that are preventing a joint plan from developing, and how close are you to a possible joint plan?",HANNAH LANG.
349,"Well, at the Fed, we are, you know, deeply committed to the mission of CRA, which is for banks to provide credit and other banking services in the communities they serve.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
350,"And we have also been of the view for some time that with the evolution of technology particularly and changes—changes in the nature of banking, that it’s an appropriate time—it’s past an appropriate time, but now it’s certainly an appropriate time to revisit the way we think about CRA.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
351,"But we don’t want to lose that focus on community, and, you know, we definitely want to see that fundamental purpose of the law sustained.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
352,"Many of the issues that we had were reflected in the OCC’s ANPR, and we’re—we’re hopeful that, over time, there will be a joint proposed rulemaking with the OCC, the FDIC, and the Fed.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
353,"It’s a process, and, you know, we’re very much interested in continuing to push it forward.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
354,"Steve Beckner, freelance journalist filing for NPR.",STEVE BECKNER.
355,"Mr. Chairman, following up on the neutral rate issue—and you touched on this—but, you know, you and your colleagues slightly lifted the longer-run estimate, the neutral funds rate estimate to 3 percent, but that’s still, I believe, like 125 basis points below where it was six years ago.",STEVE BECKNER.
356,"What are the odds that productivity, you know, investment, productivity, labor market, other developments could further push up the longer-run estimate and possibly make the projected funds rate levels less CHAIRMAN POWELL.",STEVE BECKNER.
357,"So, in principle, the—these starred variables—the long-run growth rate of the economy, the neutral rate of interest, the natural rate of unemployment—don’t move quickly.",STEVE BECKNER.
358,They move very gradually.,STEVE BECKNER.
359,"They’re pinned down by longer-run forces, like demographics.",STEVE BECKNER.
360,"In the case of the funds rate, it’s more—it’s productivity—it’s appetite for safe assets and demographics and other things, too.",STEVE BECKNER.
361,So they move quite slowly through time.,STEVE BECKNER.
362,"I think we all look at them—those of us who file SEPs every quarter will look at that every quarter and not make a change every quarter but, every now and again, make a change.",STEVE BECKNER.
363,And you’re right—we actually—the median ticked up a tenth.,STEVE BECKNER.
364,"It’s a tenth we’re talking about here, so—but still, I think it’s a positive thing that people could be raising their estimates of the longer-run neutral rate and potentially the longer-run growth rate.",STEVE BECKNER.
365,Who knows?,STEVE BECKNER.
366,"And maybe reducing their level of the natural rate of unemployment, which has been the trend.",STEVE BECKNER.
367,It’s just that you change those estimates over time.,STEVE BECKNER.
368,They’re informed by incoming data.,STEVE BECKNER.
369,"They don’t change a lot, though, although they did—it’s interesting that the neutral rate changed quite sharply after the financial crisis in many different models, and it’s been slow to recover.",STEVE BECKNER.
370,"I don’t expect a dramatic recovery there, but, you know, we—we’re so bad at forecasting productivity.",STEVE BECKNER.
371,It’s just very hard to know when productivity is going to arrive and in what quantity.,STEVE BECKNER.
372,So I think we have to be humble about how little we really know about where these starred value variables either are or are going.,STEVE BECKNER.
373,"Hi, Chairman.",PAUL KIERNAN.
374,Paul Kiernan from  Dow Jones Newswires.,PAUL KIERNAN.
375,Thank you for taking the question.,PAUL KIERNAN.
376,I’d like to just kind of ask again—you mentioned earlier that gradual—a gradual pace of rate increases will make it easier to react.,PAUL KIERNAN.
377,"But, specifically, what are you going to be looking to see, because you’ve also mentioned, you know, that monetary policy tightening cycle or where we should stop?",PAUL KIERNAN.
378,"Secondly, if you worry about the divergence between interest rates in the U.S. and internationally, especially at a time when emerging markets are under pressure.",PAUL KIERNAN.
379,Thanks.,PAUL KIERNAN.
380,Sure.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
381,"So, you know, some of the things that we’d be looking at to tell us whether we’re getting close to supply-side limits would be, first, does job growth slow down?",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
382,"A slowing down in job growth would be an indicator, you know.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
383,An unexpectedly sharp increase in wages or inflation could tell you that you’re reaching those points.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
384,"You know, if headline growth slowed down, that’s another one.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
385,So all of those things would be worth taking into consideration.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
386,"I think also, though, we’ve seen sometimes sharp tightening in financial conditions, as we saw at the beginning of 2016, can have a substantial effect pretty quickly on our economy if it’s a broad and significant tightening.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
387,So we would be looking for those kinds of things and many other things.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
388,"So, in terms of divergence, yes.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
389,"So the U.S. economy is, as I mentioned, is strong and is at a pretty positive moment, you know, with strong growth, healthy labor market, inflation right on target, as I mentioned.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
390,"So—and we’ve seen growth abroad, but growth, I think, both in advanced economies and in some emerging economies has slowed down a little bit.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
391,"And in that world, you know, if the U.S. is stronger, then that’s just part of the context, part of the environment that could mean a higher dollar.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
392,It could be—it could therefore mean that some of our demand will wind up being shared with other economies.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
393,That’s the way the integrated international economy works.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
394,"So you could see that, and, you know, it’s just—it’s just all of I would say, you know, we’re not responsible for the dollar.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
395,"Of course, the Treasury is responsible for managing the dollar, but the dollar has only partly recovered the decline that it had in 2017.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
396,"It’s moved up off its lows, but it’s not as high as it was at the beginning of last year yet by a significant margin.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
397,Hi.,JEAN YUNG.
398,Jean Yung with Market News International.,JEAN YUNG.
399,Can you give us an update on the technical adjustment in implementing monetary policy that the Fed made  earlier this year when it decoupled the interest on excess reserves rate from the upper bound of the target range?,JEAN YUNG.
400,And have you been happy with that adjustment?,JEAN YUNG.
401,And do you see the need to make another such adjustment in the near future?,JEAN YUNG.
402,So we’ve said that we would use our tools to assure that the federal funds rate trains—trades within the target range.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
403,"And the principal tools we use have been interest on excess reserves and then, at the bottom  end, a reverse repo facility.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
404,"So we—in June, when we raised rates, we only raised the interest on excess reserves by 20 basis points and raised the range by 25, and that moved federal funds sort of back into the range.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
405,"It worked, and it was successful.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
406,"The federal funds rate traded in the low 190s, well within the range.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
407,We  may—we may do that again.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
408,"You know, we—again, we have our tools, and we will use them.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
409,"We think it’s principally a function just of a number of things, but particularly high Treasury supply, and—which is showing up in repo rates and then showing up in fed funds as well.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
410,So we don’t see it as a—as a big problem.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
411,"We see it as a problem we can address with our tools, and we’ll use them if we have to.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
412,"Hi, Chairman.",COURTENAY BROWN.
413,Courtenay Brown from  Axios.,COURTENAY BROWN.
414,"Last month, the CEA outlined a different way to calculate wage growth.",COURTENAY BROWN.
415,"Has the Fed looked at that at all, and CHAIRMAN POWELL.",COURTENAY BROWN.
416,"So I wouldn’t comment on a CEA paper, and I would imagine they probably wouldn’t comment on our stuff, either, but I would just say this.",COURTENAY BROWN.
417,So I am familiar with the question and the work.,COURTENAY BROWN.
418,"You know, we look—we look at a range of indicators of wages, and I think the broader, the better.",COURTENAY BROWN.
419,"You really—in a perfect—a perfect wage measure would also include benefits, because a lot of compensation these days shows up in the form of benefits rather than wages, so I think it’s right to choose those broader ones.",COURTENAY BROWN.
420,But they’re kind of all telling the same story right now.,COURTENAY BROWN.
421,"If you look at the principal four that we look at—we look at a whole range of wage and benefit cost indicators—they are all now showing wages and benefits around 3 percent growth, right?",COURTENAY BROWN.
422,Clustered around 3 percent.,COURTENAY BROWN.
423,That’s a full percentage point higher than it was five years ago.,COURTENAY BROWN.
424,That’s a good thing.,COURTENAY BROWN.
425,"Then the question—the other question is, what about inflation?",COURTENAY BROWN.
426,"You know, if you’re—if you’re looking for real wage increases, you’ve got to ask inflation, and there, you have to pick an inflation measure.",COURTENAY BROWN.
427,Some people pick CPI.,COURTENAY BROWN.
428,"We, of course, pick personal consumption expenditures because we think it’s a little better measure.",COURTENAY BROWN.
429,"It’s a little broader, and it tends to run a little bit lower as well, but that’s not why we pick it.",COURTENAY BROWN.
430,We just think it’s more accurate.,COURTENAY BROWN.
431,"And that—the trend there is running around 2 percent, so if wages are running at rough—wages and benefits running at roughly 3 percent and inflation running at around 2 percent.",COURTENAY BROWN.
432,PCE headline inflation is at 2.3 percent.,COURTENAY BROWN.
433,"PCE core is at about 2, and I think we see that, you know, the temporary increase in headline inflation as being a function of oil prices probably, and we expect inflation to go back down to 2 percent.",COURTENAY BROWN.
434,So we think of that as 2 percent.,COURTENAY BROWN.
435,That’s how we think about it.,COURTENAY BROWN.
436,Is that—I hope that helps.,COURTENAY BROWN.
437,"Myles Udland, Yahoo Finance.",MYLES UDLAND.
438,"Chair Powell, I want to follow up challenges for the economy, and you mentioned that addressing the federal budget deficit, which has long been on an unsustainable path, becomes increasingly important as a larger share of the population retires.",MYLES UDLAND.
439,"I’m just wondering if you could, you know, maybe expand on your thoughts there and if this is an issue that comes up among members of the FOMC at all.",MYLES UDLAND.
440,So it doesn’t really come up.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
441,It’s not really our job.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
442,And we do—we do monetary policy.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
443,"We regulate financial institutions, financial stability, that sort of thing.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
444,We don’t have responsibility for fiscal policy.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
445,"But in  the longer-run, fiscal policy will have a significant effect on the economy, so for that reason, I  think my predecessors have commented on fiscal policy.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
446,"But they’ve commented on—at a high level rather than trying to get involved in particular, you know, particular measures.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
447,And so—and I—my plan is to kind of stick to the same approach and stay in our lane.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
448,"And, you know—so I would just say, it’s—it’s no secret, it’s been true for a long time that with our uniquely expensive health-care delivery system  and the aging of our population, we’ve been on an unsustainable fiscal path for a long time, and there’s no hiding from  it.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
449,"In the end, we will have to face that, and I think, you know, the sooner, the better.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
450,"And also, these are good times.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
451,"These are, you know, this is—this is the economy at nearly full employment or in the range—in the neighborhood of full employment.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
452,Interest rates are low.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
453,It’s a—it’s a good time to be addressing these things.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
454,So I just—I put that out there and leave it at that.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
455,I’m Takeshi Kawanami from Nikkei newspaper.,TAKESHI KAWANAMI.
456,Thank you for taking my question.,TAKESHI KAWANAMI.
457,I’d like to ask about emerging markets.,TAKESHI KAWANAMI.
458,"What do you think about impact of U.S. monetary policy on emerging markets—interest rate, currency depreciation, or capital outflow from emerging countries?",TAKESHI KAWANAMI.
459,And do you think there is a possibility to stop the interest rate CHAIRMAN POWELL.,TAKESHI KAWANAMI.
460,"Sorry, the second question was?",TAKESHI KAWANAMI.
461,There is a possibility to stop the .,TAKESHI KAWANAMI.
462,"Oh, to stop.",. . CHAIRMAN POWELL.
463,TAKESHI KAWANAMI. . . . hike.,. . CHAIRMAN POWELL.
464,"Well, we serve a domestic mandate, which is assigned to us by Congress, and that is to have maximum employment and stable prices.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
465,"About half of global GDP is outside the United States, and way more than half of the growth is outside the United States and in emerging markets, I should say.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
466,"And so the performance in the emerging market economies really, really matters to us in carrying out our domestic mandate.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
467,"I’d also say that, you know, a strong U.S. economy, where Americans are buying things and the economy is growing and our—you know, that’s going to support demand all around the globe, so that’s a good thing.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
468,"Now, we do understand, though, that when we—when our economy is strong and we’re raising rates, that puts upward pressure on interest rates around the world and can affect countries, particularly countries that have significant external dollar borrowing.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
469,And what we try to do is be very transparent about what we’re doing and why.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
470,"And we have been, I believe, and we’ve also moved quite gradually.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
471,"So I—you know, I think we’ve been performing well on that front.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
472,"There are some countries that are—that are undergoing severe stress, a handful of them, and—but not most emerging market countries.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
473,"It’s a relatively small number, and those particular countries have, you know, have particular vulnerabilities, which are well known in the form of budget deficits, and significant external dollar borrowings, and high inflation, and things possibly can, and that’s really the best thing we can do, along with supporting U.S. growth.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
474,"I’ll just—I think that answers both your questions, actually.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.

476,"You mentioned earlier a possible, not probable, correction, and I want to come back to the high level of the stock market.",VIRGINIE MONTET.
477,Are there any participants to the FOMC to think that we are witnessing an episode of irrational exuberance or rational exuberance?,VIRGINIE MONTET.
478,"And if there was a steep correction, would it provoke financial stability concerns?",VIRGINIE MONTET.
479,So I don’t comment on the appropriateness of the level of stock prices.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
480,"I can say that by some valuation measures, they’re in the upper range of their historical value ranges.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
481,"But, you know, I wouldn’t want to—I wouldn’t want to speculate about what the consequences of a market correction should be.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
482,"You know, we would—we would look very carefully at the nature of it, and I mean, it—really—really what hurts is if consumers are borrowing heavily and doing so against, for example, an asset that can fall in value.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
483,So that’s a really serious matter when you have a housing bubble and highly levered consumers and housing values fall.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
484,And we know that that’s a really bad situation.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
485,"A simple drop in equity prices is— all by itself, doesn’t really have those features.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
486,"It could certainly feature—it could certainly affect consumption and have a negative effect on the economy, though.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
487,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",MARK HAMRICK.
488,Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.com.,MARK HAMRICK.
489,"One thing that’s changed since the crisis is, the majority of mortgages issued last year came from so-called nonbank lenders, as traditional banks scaled back.",MARK HAMRICK.
490,"What confidence do you have about supervision and, I suppose, also regulation in this space given the role of housing finance in the CHAIRMAN POWELL.",MARK HAMRICK.
491,It’s a good question.,MARK HAMRICK.
492,So you’re right that a lot of mortgages are now originated outside the system.,MARK HAMRICK.
493,"Many of those, though, have to meet certain basic standards to be bought by the GSEs.",MARK HAMRICK.
494,"I think we—if we look at mortgage credit more broadly, though, what we see is that credit is pretty widely available to people with high scores and with good credit— good credit records, and much, much less available than it was before the crisis to people with low scores and perhaps troubled credit history.",MARK HAMRICK.
495,"You know, it’s—have we—have we set—have we got that exactly right?",MARK HAMRICK.
496,I don’t know.,MARK HAMRICK.
497,"I mean, I—but that’s clearly—that’s the reality.",MARK HAMRICK.
498,"In terms of those institutions, they do have supervision by the CFPB and other state regulators.",MARK HAMRICK.
499,But you’re right.,MARK HAMRICK.
500,They’re much—much of the origination process has moved outside the banking,MARK HAMRICK.
