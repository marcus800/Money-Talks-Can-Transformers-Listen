0,Good afternoon.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
1,Thanks very much for being here.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2,"I know that a number of you will want to talk about the details of our announcement today, and I am happy to do that in a few minutes.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
3,"But because monetary policy affects everyone, I want to start with a plain-English summary of how the economy is doing, what my colleagues and I at the Federal Reserve are trying to do, and why.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
4,The main takeaway is that the economy is doing very well.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
5,"Most people who want to find jobs are finding them, and unemployment and inflation are low.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
6,Interest rates have been low for some years while the economy has been recovering from the financial crisis.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
7,"For the past few years, we have been gradually raising interest rates, and along the way we’ve tried to explain the reasoning behind our decisions.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
8,"In particular, we think that gradually returning interest rates to a more normal level as the economy strengthens is the best way the Fed can help sustain an environment in which American households and businesses can thrive.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
9,"Today, we’ve taken another step in that process by raising our target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ of a percentage point.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
10,My colleagues and I meet eight times a year and take a fresh look each time at what is happening in the economy and consider whether our policy needs adjusting.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
11,"We don’t put our interest rate decisions on hold or on autopilot, because the economy can always evolve in unexpected ways.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
12,History has shown that moving interest rates either too quickly or too slowly can lead to bad economic outcomes.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
13,We think the outcomes are likely to be better overall if we are as clear as possible about what we are likely to do and why.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
14,"To that end, we try to give a sense of our expectations for how the economy will evolve and how our policy stance may change.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
15,"As Chairman, I hope to foster a public conversation about what the Fed is doing to support a strong and resilient economy.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
16,And one practical step in doing so is to have a press conference like this after every one of our scheduled FOMC meetings.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
17,And we’re going to do that beginning in January.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
18,That will give us more opportunities to explain our actions and to answer your questions.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
19,I want to point out that having twice as many press conferences does not signal anything about the timing or pace of future interest rate changes.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
20,This change is only about improving communications.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
21,My FOMC colleagues and I will also continue to issue our economic projections on the existing quarterly schedule.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
22,"Now, let me go into more detail over developments in the economy, our economic projections, and our policy decision.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
23,"Economic growth appears to have picked up in the current quarter, largely reflecting a bounceback in household spending.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
24,"Business investment continues to grow strongly, and the overall outlook for growth remains favorable.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
25,"Several factors support this assessment:  Fiscal policy is boosting the economy, ongoing job gains are raising incomes and confidence, foreign economies continue to expand, and overall financial conditions remain accommodative.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
26,These observations are consistent with the projections that Committee participants submitted for this meeting.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
27,"The median projection for the growth of real GDP is 2.8 percent this year, 2.4 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2020.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
28,"Compared with the projections made in March, this median growth path is little changed.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
29,"In the labor market, job gains averaged 180,000 per month over the past three months, well above the pace needed in the longer run to provide jobs for new entrants into the workforce.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
30,"The unemployment rate declined over the past two months and stood at 3.8 percent in May, its lowest level in nearly two decades.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
31,"Meanwhile, the labor force participation rate has been roughly unchanged since late 2013.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
32,"That is a positive sign, given that the aging of our population is putting downward pressure on the participation rate.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
33,And we expect the job market to remain strong.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
34,"As you can see in our Summary of Economic Projections, the median of Committee participants’ projections for the unemployment rate stands at 3.6 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and runs at 3.5 percent over the next two years, a percentage point below the median estimate of its longer-run normal rate.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
35,This median path is just a bit lower than that from March.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
36,"After many years of running below our 2 percent longer-run objective, inflation has recently moved close to that level.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
37,"Indeed, overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, increased 2 percent over the 12 months ending in April.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
38,"The core PCE index, which excludes prices of energy and food and tends to be a better indicator of future inflation, rose 1.8 percent over the same period.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
39,"As we had expected, inflation moved up as the unusually low readings from last March dropped out of the calculation.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
40,"The recent inflation data have been encouraging, but after many years of inflation below our objective, we do not want to declare victory.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
41,We want to ensure that inflation remains near our symmetric 2 percent longer-run goal on a sustained basis.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
42,"As we note in our Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below our 2 percent objective.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
43,"Of course, many factors affect inflation—some temporary and others more lasting—and at any given time inflation may be above or below 2 percent.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
44,"For example, the recent rise in oil prices will likely push inflation somewhat above 2 percent in coming months.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
45,"But that transitory development should have little, if any, consequence for inflation over the next few years.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
46,The median of participants’ projections for inflation runs at 2.1 percent through 2020.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
47,"Relative to the March projections, the median inflation projection is a little higher this year and next.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
48,"As I mentioned, today we took another step in gradually scaling back monetary policy accommodation by raising the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing it to 1¾ to 2 percent.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
49,"We also made some changes to our policy statement, reflecting that policy normalization is proceeding broadly as we have expected.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
50,None of these changes signals a change in our policy views.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
51,"For example, we removed the language stating that “the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.”  Since we introduced that language a few years ago, the economy has strengthened, and the Committee has raised the federal funds rate from near 0 to 1¾ to 2 percent.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
52,"As we continue to note in our statement, we expect to make further gradual increases in that rate.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
53,"As a result, if the economy evolves broadly as we anticipate, the federal funds rate will, over the next year or so, move well within the range of estimates of the normal long-run level.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
54,"Therefore, we thought that now is an appropriate time to remove this forward guidance from our policy statement.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
55,"We continue to believe that a gradual approach for increasing the federal funds rate will best promote a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent goal.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
56,"We are aware that raising rates too slowly might raise the risk that monetary policy would need to tighten abruptly down the road in response to an unexpectedly sharp increase in inflation or financial excesses, jeopardizing the economic expansion.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
57,"Conversely, if we raise interest rates too rapidly, the economy could weaken, and inflation could continue to run persistently below our objective.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
58,The Committee’s gradual approach is reflected in participants’ projections for the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
59,"The median projection for the federal funds rate is 2.4 percent at the end of this year, 3.1 percent at the end of 2019, and 3.4 percent at the end of 2020.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
60,"By 2020, the median federal funds rate is modestly above its estimated longer-run level.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
61,These projections are very similar to those made in March.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
62,"Although the median federal funds rate edged up this year and next, most participants did not revise their projections.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
63,I’ll conclude by mentioning two additional matters.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
64,"First, our program for reducing our balance sheet, which began in October, is proceeding smoothly.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
65,"Barring a material and unexpected weakening in the outlook, this program will proceed on schedule, and our balance sheet will continue to shrink.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
66,"As we have said, changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
67,"And, finally, as discussed in the minutes of our May meeting, we’re making a small technical adjustment in one of our tools for implementing monetary policy.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
68,"To keep the federal funds rate in the target range, we rely on the rate of interest on excess reserves, or the IOER rate.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
69,"Up until now, we have set the IOER rate at the top of the target range for the federal funds rate.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
70,"In recent months, the federal funds rate has moved up toward the IOER rate as short-term interest rates have risen more generally.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
71,"So to move the federal funds rate closer to the middle of the target range, we are now setting the IOER rate 5 basis points below the upper end of the target range.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
72,This minor technical adjustment has no bearing on the appropriate path for the federal funds rate or financial conditions more generally.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
73,"Thanks for listening, and I’ll be happy to take your questions.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
74,"Hi, Mr. Chairman.",JIM TANKERSLEY.
75,"Jim Tankersley, New York Times.",JIM TANKERSLEY.
76,I have a question about inflation and a question about growth.,JIM TANKERSLEY.
77,"On inflation, I’m curious if there’s anything that’s happened since March that has changed your assessment of the risk of inflation increases beyond what you forecast in the year to come.",JIM TANKERSLEY.
78,"And, on growth, you mentioned fiscal policy is adding to growth, and I’m curious if you could break that down a little bit further for us and say—what effects do you think the recent tax cuts are having on growth?",JIM TANKERSLEY.
79,Sure.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
80,So since—I wouldn’t say anything has happened since March to really change the way I’m thinking about inflation or the way the Committee’s thinking about inflation.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
81,We’ve seen inflation move very gradually up toward our 2 percent objective.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
82,"And part of that has been just idiosyncratic things dropping out from last March, which were holding inflation—measured inflation—down.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
83,Part of it is just that continued tightening in the labor market and the economy more broadly is pushing inflation up.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
84,"So we continue to think, and the Committee continues to think, that we are just about at our 2 percent goal but, as I mentioned, not ready to declare victory until we sustain that over time, which we haven’t done yet.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
85,"You also asked about fiscal policy, and there’s a range of views on the Committee and, I think more broadly, a range of views among economists generally.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
86,"But I can say that the Committee members—Committee participants—generally believe that the fiscal changes—and that includes both the tax cuts, individual and corporate, and the spending changes—will provide meaningful support to demand, significant support to demand over the course of the next three years.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
87,"And the question—the other question is, what about the supply side?",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
88,"So it is—it makes sense that if you lower corporate tax rates and allow faster expensing of investment, you will encourage greater investment.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
89,That should drive productivity.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
90,That should increase potential output.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
91,So that really ought to happen as well.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
92,I think the amounts and the timing of that coming in are also quite uncertain.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
93,"There’s also the possibility that there would be more labor supply from lower individual tax rates, again, in amounts and in timing that might be more uncertain.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
94,So that’s how the Committee generally is thinking about—about fiscal policy.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
95,Thanks.,NICK TIMIRAOS.
96,"Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal.",NICK TIMIRAOS.
97,"So the Fed is about four interest rate increases, using the projections released today, away from what might be considered a neutral fed funds rate.",NICK TIMIRAOS.
98,And I wanted to ask how you’re thinking about what to do once you get to neutral.,NICK TIMIRAOS.
99,"Under what conditions would you decide, once you get there, that it’s okay to stop raising rates?",NICK TIMIRAOS.
100,And under what conditions would you want to keep going?,NICK TIMIRAOS.
101,"So for many, many years, we’ve been far from maximum employment and stable prices, and so the need for accommodative policy has been—has been clear.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
102,"As the economy has strengthened and as we’ve gradually raised interest rates, the question comes into view of, how much longer will you need to be accommodative?",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
103,And how will you know?,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
104,How will you know where—at what point policy will be neutral?,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
105,Neutral meaning that interest rates are neither pushing the economy up nor trying to restrain it.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
106,So we know that we’re getting closer to that neutral level.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
107,We don’t have an exact sense of how that will be.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
108,"So the Committee is discussing, very actively, the questions that you raise.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
109,"And, really, it boils down to a question of, what is appropriate policy?",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
110,"And, you know, I—you asked, how will we know?",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
111,"So I think we’ll be very carefully looking at incoming data on inflation, on financial readings, and on the labor market.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
112,"We have to acknowledge that there are always wide uncertainty bands around the level of, for example, the natural rate of unemployment.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
113,"But also, what is the neutral rate of interest?",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
114,What is that rate of interest that pushes neither up nor down?,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
115,So I think we—we’ll be guided by incoming data on the economy and try to keep our minds open as we move forward.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
116,Howard Schneider with Reuters.,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
117,"2.1 percent above target for two and a half years starts to feel like some of the alternate frameworks that have been discussed here, be it price-level targeting or trying to set expectations higher so that you hit your 2.",HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
118,"In deciding how symmetric is too symmetric, what sort of parameters are you using on that front?",HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
119,"You know, the—our target for—our medium-term objective for inflation is 2 percent PCE inflation.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
120,"We feel that that target has served the economy well, and I’m strongly committed to it.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
121,The Committee is strongly committed to it.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
122,"The sort of barriers to making a material change to that would be—would be very high because, again, we think it’s fundamental, and we think it’s worked.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
123,You asked about price-level targeting and that sort of thing.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
124,"You know, there are some ideas that sort of take cognizance of the fact that rates are lower, we’re near the zero lower bound, and that could put downward pressure on inflation expectations if we’re going to be down at the zero lower bound and, therefore, sort of undermine the credibility of the 2 percent inflation objective.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
125,So the idea is to have kind of a makeup.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
126,"If you—if you’re below target for a while, you have a—you have a time of being above target.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
127,And the idea is to enhance the credibility of that 2 percent—that 2 percent target.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
128,This is an idea that’s been written about for many years.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
129,It’s not something that the Committee has looked at seriously.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
130,"I imagine we will be having discussions about it, but—not something that we have on the calendar right now.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
131,"Well, thanks very much.",SAM FLEMING.
132,Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.,SAM FLEMING.
133,"Over the weekend, we saw some significant tensions within the G-7.",SAM FLEMING.
134,"In Canada, there is the potential, obviously, for further action against China right now and retaliatory action from major U.S. trading partners.",SAM FLEMING.
135,How big a risk do you currently see this as being to the United States economy?,SAM FLEMING.
136,And what kind of feedback are you getting in terms of corporate investment intentions?,SAM FLEMING.
137,Is there something that’s beginning to feature more prominently in your own discussions with major U.S. companies?,SAM FLEMING.
138,Thanks.,SAM FLEMING.
139,"I ought to start by saying that, you know, Congress has assigned us very important jobs and—you know, maximum employment, stable prices, we have a role in financial stability that we share with other agencies.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
140,"Congress has very specifically given authority over trade to the executive branch, so I wouldn’t comment on any particular specific trade actions.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
141,"I will say that we, of course, have—we have broad contacts in—among business leaders around the country.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
142,"And the Reserve Bank presidents, in particular, have that.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
143,And so they report in the Beige Book and then in person at the FOMC meeting.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
144,"And they do come back and they say that concerns about changes in trade policy are arising, I think it’s fair to say, and also that you’re beginning to hear reports of companies holding off on making investments and hiring people.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
145,So right now we don’t see that in the numbers at all.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
146,The economy is very strong.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
147,The labor market is strong.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
148,Growth is strong.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
149,We really don’t see it in the numbers.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
150,It’s just not there.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
151,But—so I would put it down as more of a risk.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
152,"Steve Liesman, CNBC.",STEVE LIESMAN.
153,"Mr. Chairman, you said there’s a difference of opinion among economists, but looking at the longer-run GDP growth rates for the members of the Committee, there’s not a whole lot of difference.",STEVE LIESMAN.
154,"It’s 1.8 to 2, or 1.7 to 2.1, depending upon how you count it.",STEVE LIESMAN.
155,"Is that showing us that not a single member of the Committee—including yourself, Mr. Chairman—agrees with economists over at the White House that they can achieve long-run sustained growth rates above or at 3 percent or higher?",STEVE LIESMAN.
156,Do you believe in that?,STEVE LIESMAN.
157,"You know, first of all, that’s a—that’s a reasonable range, I think, of—it’s not that we’re all on the same number, but there are a range of views about potential growth.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
158,And there’s so much uncertainty around this.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
159,"You know, we don’t—the thing about fiscal policy is, you don’t have thousands of incidents to, you know, to—you don’t have big data, in a way.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
160,You have very small data.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
161,"You’ve got only a few instances here, so you have a lot of uncertainty around what the effects will be.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
162,They could be large.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
163,We hope they’re large.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
164,"But I think our approach is going to be to watch and see and hope that, in fact, we do get significant effects to, you know, to potential growth out of the tax bill, and we’re just going to have to see.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
165,How would you forecast it though?,STEVE LIESMAN.
166,I think we’re looking at a reasonable range of estimates and we’re putting every—different participants are putting different estimates in and we’re going to be waiting and seeing.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
167,Donna Borak with CNN.,DONNA BORAK.
168,You said earlier that it’s still a little too early to declare victory on inflation.,DONNA BORAK.
169,I wanted to circle back on a question that was asked at the initial press conference about what—what does the Fed say in regards to the inflation target as symmetric?,DONNA BORAK.
170,"Like has the Committee given any further thought in terms of how comfortable it would be rising above—whether it goes higher than 2.1, if it reaches 2.2, 2.3, and for how long?",DONNA BORAK.
171,"And now that you’re planning to hold these regular press conferences, starting next year, how do you explain—how do you plan to explain that to the American people that inflation is not overrunning?",DONNA BORAK.
172,"You know, what we’ve said in our Statement of Longer-Run Principles and Monetary Policy Strategy is that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were to run persistently above or below 2 percent, persistently above or below 2 percent.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
173,And that’s what we mean by symmetric.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
174,We’re looking at it equally on either side and it’s a matter of persistent overruns.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
175,We know that inflation is going to bounce around.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
176,"For example, as I mentioned, later this summer there’s a good chance that headline inflation will move up above 2 percent because of oil prices.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
177,"Things buffet inflation back and forth, but—so we acknowledge that, we understand that—and if inflation were to persistently run above or below 2 percent, then we would be using our tools to try to move inflation back in the direction of the target.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
178,"We do understand, though, that we don’t have the ability to precisely hit that target, so we expect that inflation will be above or below.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
179,And we just hope that that is—happens on a symmetric basis.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
180,"Marty Crutsinger, Associated Press.",MARTIN CRUTSINGER.
181,"At this meeting, you hiked your—the funds rate, you changed the dot plot to move from 3 to 4 for this year, and you took out a sentence that you’d been using for years about how long rates might stay low.",MARTIN CRUTSINGER.
182,But you say that none of this signals a change in policy views.,MARTIN CRUTSINGER.
183,But shouldn’t we see from this combination of things that the Fed is moving to tighter policy?,MARTIN CRUTSINGER.
184,I think what you should see is that the economy is continuing to make progress.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
185,"The economy has strengthened so much since I joined the Fed, you know, in 2012 and even over the last couple of years.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
186,The economy is in a very different place.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
187,We— unemployment was 10 percent at the height of the crisis.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
188,It’s 3.8 percent now and moving lower.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
189,So really what you—the decision you see today is another sign that the U.S. economy is in great shape.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
190,"Growth is strong, labor markets are strong, inflation is close to target, and that’s what you’re seeing.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
191,"For many years, as I mentioned—many years—we had interest rates held low to support economic activity.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
192,"And it’s been clear that as we’ve gotten closer to our statutory goals, we should normalize policy, and that’s really what we’ve been consistently doing for some years now.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
193,"Hi, Chair Powell.",HEATHER LONG.
194,Heather Long from the Washington Post.,HEATHER LONG.
195,Can you give us an update on what the FOMC thinks about wages?,HEATHER LONG.
196,Are we finally going to see that wage growth pickup this year?,HEATHER LONG.
197,"I know you’re forecasting a little bit more inflation, but is that going to translate through to wage growth?",HEATHER LONG.
198,"You know, wages have been gradually moving up.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
199,"Earlier in the recovery, they were—there are many different wage measures, of course, but—so just—but just to generalize, wages were running roughly around 2 percent and they’ve moved gradually up into between 2 to 3 percent as the labor market has become stronger and stronger.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
200,"I think it’s fair to say that some of us—and I certainly would have expected wages to react more to the very significant reduction in unemployment that we’ve had, as I mentioned, from 10 percent to 3.8 percent.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
201,"Part of that can be explained by low productivity, which is something we’ve talked about at the Committee and elsewhere.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
202,"But, nonetheless, I think we had anticipated, and many people have anticipated, that wages—that in a world where we’re hearing lots and lots about labor shortages—everywhere we go now, we hear about labor shortages—but where is the wage reaction?",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
203,So it’s a bit of a puzzle.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
204,"I wouldn’t say it’s a mystery, but it’s a bit of a puzzle.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
205,"And, frankly, I do think there’s a lot to like about low unemployment.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
206,"And one of the things is—you will see—pretty much people who want to get jobs—not everybody—but people who want to get jobs, many of them will be able to get jobs.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
207,You will see wages go up.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
208,"You’ll see people at the, sort of, the margins of the labor force having an opportunity to get back in work.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
209,They benefit from that.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
210,Society benefits from that.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
211,"So there are a lot of things to really like, including higher wages, as you asked.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
212,"Our role, though, is also to, you know, to make sure that—that maximum employment happens in a context of price stability and financial stability, which is why we’re gradually raising rates.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
213,Just a follow-up on—Don Lee from the L.A. Times.,DON LEE.
214,"On both inflation and unemployment, the new projections—for unemployment lower than before and inflation higher.",DON LEE.
215,And how much is the Fed willing to accept that’s an overshoot for both of those before it affects policy?,DON LEE.
216,You mentioned that unemployment moved down and inflation moved up by truly small amounts.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
217,"If you look at the Summary of Economic Projections, things are moving by just a tick or even a semitick between now and March.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
218,"And you asked, you know—I mean, I think we take a longer-run view that we’re shooting for—we’re aiming for—2 percent inflation—inflation around 2 percent.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
219,We know that it’ll be above or below.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
220,"We’re not going to—we didn’t overreact, I think, to inflation being under 2 percent.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
221,We won’t overreact to it being over 2 percent.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
222,"And I think we’ll always be using our tools to move inflation in the direction of the target, if it—if it leaves—if it moves away from the target persistently, as I mentioned.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
223,"In terms of unemployment, you know, you have to acknowledge that we are—no one really knows with certainty what the level of the natural rate of unemployment is, the rate that is sustainable over a long period of time.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
224,"And we know that probably that rate has declined as the U.S. population has become more educated, as it has become older.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
225,Older and more educated people have lower unemployment rates.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
226,We don’t know this with precision.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
227,So we have to be learning as we go.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
228,We’ve got to be looking at data and informed by what’s coming in.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
229,"And as I mentioned, I think at the last press conference, estimates by the—by members of the Committee have moved down by a full percentage point since maybe 2012 as we’ve learned—as unemployment has dropped and inflation hasn’t really reacted.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
230,"So I can’t give you a precise number, but I just—you know, we will be very much informed by incoming data.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
231,And this uncertainty is why—the fact that we live in that uncertainty is why we’ve been gradually raising rates.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
232,We’re not waiting for inflation to show up.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
233,"We’re going ahead and moving gradually and trying to navigate between two risks, really.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
234,One would be moving too quickly—inflation never gets back to target if we do that.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
235,"And the other is moving too slowly, and then we have—we have too much inflation or financial instability, and we have to raise quickly.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
236,And that can also have bad outcomes.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
237,"Chris Condon, Bloomberg News.",CHRISTOPHER CONDON.
238,"Mr. Chairman, I have a couple questions about the interest the Fed pays on excess reserves.",CHRISTOPHER CONDON.
239,"And you mentioned, of course, that—that the IOER was raised by the Committee 20 basis points, and that’s a result, as you said, of the upward drift of the effective fed funds rate in that target range.",CHRISTOPHER CONDON.
240,Do you think that that’s going to resolve that issue or might there be further action required by the Committee in the future to continue lowering IOER relative to the midpoint of the range?,CHRISTOPHER CONDON.
241,"And, further, was there discussion among the Committee today about what’s causing that?",CHRISTOPHER CONDON.
242,"Is it purely technical, perhaps related to bill issuance, or is it telling you something about the level of scarcity and truly excess bank reserves?",CHRISTOPHER CONDON.
243,Thank you.,CHRISTOPHER CONDON.
244,Thanks.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
245,So I would say that—remember the important thing is that we want the federal funds rate to trade in the target range.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
246,"That’s the whole, the whole idea.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
247,IOER is the principal tool by which we assure that that will happen.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
248,"And we’ve said in our, you know, basic documents that we will adjust the use of our tools, as appropriate.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
249,"We don’t expect to have to do this often or again, but we’re not sure about that.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
250,"If we have to do it again, we’ll do it again.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
251,"Again, don’t expect it to happen.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
252,You asked why.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
253,"And yes, you know, we—of course, we’re looking carefully at that and, you know, the truth is we don’t—we don’t know with any precision.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
254,"Really, no one does.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
255,"It’s—you can’t run experiments, you know, with one effect and not the other.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
256,"You know, I think there’s a lot of probability on the idea of just high bill supply leads to higher repo costs, higher money market rates generally, and the arbitrage pulls up federal funds rate towards IOER.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
257,"We don’t know that that’s the only effect and, you know, we’re just going to have to be watching and learning.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
258,"And, frankly, we don’t have to know today.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
259,"What we really need is to have the federal funds rate trade in the range, and that’s what this minor technical adjustment accomplishes.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
260,Edward Lawrence from Fox Business.,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
261,"So with the numbers that we’re looking at, you talked about more people getting jobs, the wages are increasing.",EDWARD LAWRENCE.
262,"Are we seeing a—with the fiscal policy—a fundamental shift in the economy, where we have lower natural unemployment, also possibly a lower rate of natural unemployment and lower inflation?",EDWARD LAWRENCE.
263,"Your question—your first question, really, is, do we think the natural rate of unemployment is lower?",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
264,So I think we do believe it has moved down significantly over a long period of time.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
265,"We don’t think that the natural rate of unemployment—you know, it’s not one of those variables that moves around a lot.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
266,"It tends to be driven by slow-moving variables, like the education level, the population, like the functioning of the labor market, and things like that.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
267,"So, you know, it may—it may have moved down too, on a cyclical basis, lower.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
268,"As the economy gets hotter and hotter, there’s some possibility of that.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
269,"But, you know, the thing is, if you look back, there have been a lot of studies done and, you know, real-time estimates of the natural rate of unemployment have uncertainty bands, which are—which are quite wide, so we have to remember that and very much be guided by the—by the incoming data.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
270,You asked about inflation.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
271,"You know, inflation we look about—we look at the 2 percent inflation objective as something that central banks, the Fed, really control.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
272,And we have to be strongly committed to achieving that using our tools to do that.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
273,"I think in—in recent years the dominant force has been, you know, disinflationary—have been pushing down on inflation.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
274,And so we’ve been pushing back up.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
275,"Of course, all those years when we were growing up, it was the opposite.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
276,Inflation was too high and central banks were constantly pushing down.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
277,"It’s really important that inflation not fall below 2 percent, that inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent—very important—because the implications of inflation below 2 percent are that you’re closer to the zero lower bound, meaning the Fed has less room to cut, meaning that we’ll spend more time there and we won’t be able to do the job that we’re assigned to do for our citizens.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
278,Jeanna Smialek with Bloomberg Television.,JEANNA SMIALEK.
279,You guys moved the median unemployment forecast for 2020 down to 3.5 percent but left the longer-run at 4.5 percent today.,JEANNA SMIALEK.
280,But you’re only forecasting a moderate overshoot on the fed funds rate beyond your longer-run value.,JEANNA SMIALEK.
281,How are you going to get unemployment from 3.5 percent up to that 4.5 percent rate?,JEANNA SMIALEK.
282,"I would just—would—I would just emphasize, emphasize that—a couple things.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
283,"First, we’re learning about the real location of the natural rate of unemployment as we go.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
284,So it’s moved down by more than a full percentage point since 2012.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
285,"So it’s not so simple as thinking, oh boy, we’ve just got to go ahead and get that rate up.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
286,"If you—if you look at the forecast, two years from now, end of 2020, you’re still seeing inflation very close to target.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
287,"So there’s no sense that inflation will—no sense in our models, or in our projections, or forecasts—that inflation will take off or move unexpectedly quickly from these levels, even if unemployment does remain low.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
288,So that’s—that’s what—so it’s important to know that the—the unemployment rate forecasts go with the inflation forecasts and go with the rate forecasts.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
289,"And so each person who’s submitting them is submitting accommodate—you know, appropriate monetary policy that fits with that person’s assessment.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
290,And their assessments generally are to support maximum employment and stable prices around 2 percent.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
291,"So if we thought that inflation were going to take off, obviously, we’d be showing higher rates, but that’s not what we think will happen.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
292,If I could just follow up really quickly.,JEANNA SMIALEK.
293,"Then why, I guess, would the longer-run unemployment rate not be a little bit lower and closer to that 2020 number?",JEANNA SMIALEK.
294,"Yeah, it may be.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
295,It may be.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
296,We may find that out.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
297,"You know, the best estimate that we have, over the longer run, is that.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
298,"Although, you know, there’s a range of views, you know.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
299,"Some people are in the low 4s, and, again, I said the uncertainty bands are, you know, not quite a full percentage point on either side, but ¾ of a percent, that kind of thing, so it’s very possible.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
300,"We have to be, you know—we can’t do—we can’t be too attached to these unobservable variables.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
301,"You know, we—I think we have to be practical about the way we think about these things and we do that by being grounded in the data and what we see happening in the real economy.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
302,I have a couple of regulatory questions.,VICTORIA GUIDA.
303,"First of all, on the countercyclical capital buffer, I was wondering, what are the chances that the Fed is going to need to use that in the next year or two?",VICTORIA GUIDA.
304,"And then my second question is, there’s been a lot of talk lately in Congress about the ability for banks to serve marijuana businesses, and I was wondering if you think that banks should be able to serve those businesses in states where marijuana is legal.",VICTORIA GUIDA.
305,So the countercyclical capital buffer gives us the ability to raise capital requirements on the largest institutions when financial stability vulnerabilities are meaningfully above normal.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
306,That’s the language that we’ve used.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
307,And that’s certainly a possibility.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
308,I wouldn’t say that—I wouldn't look at today’s financial stability landscape and say that risks are meaningfully above normal.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
309,I would say that they’re roughly at normal.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
310,"You have—you know, households are well—you know, are in good shape.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
311,"They’re—they’ve paid down their debt, incomes are rising, people have jobs.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
312,So households are not really a concern.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
313,"And banks are highly capitalized, so that’s not really a concern.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
314,We see—there’s some concern with asset prices in a couple of pockets.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
315,"But overall, if you—if you bake it all in, I think we see, generally, financial vulnerabilities as moderate.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
316,"Could that change, you asked, over a couple of years?",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
317,"Yeah, it could.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
318,You also asked about marijuana businesses.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
319,So this is a very difficult area because we have state law—many state laws permit the use of marijuana and federal law still doesn’t.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
320,"So it puts, you know, federally chartered banks in a very difficult situation.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
321,I think it would be great if that could be clarified.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
322,"We don’t have—you know, it puts the supervisor in a very, very difficult position.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
323,"And, of course, this isn’t our—our mandate has nothing to do with marijuana, so we don’t really—we just would love to see it clarified, I think.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
324,"Hi, John Heltman with American Banker.",JOHN HELTMAN.
325,"So since you—since even before you were Chairman of the Fed, when you were chair of the supervisory committee, you laid out a sort of regulatory revision agenda that’s actually been pretty consistent.",JOHN HELTMAN.
326,"So there was the guidance on boards of governors, there was the—some changes to the stress tests, and—not changes to the stress test, but rather clarification on the modeling—and now, more recently, the changes to the enhanced supplemental leverage ratio.",JOHN HELTMAN.
327,"The Fed has also proposed some changes to the Volcker rule and, as I mentioned a minute ago, changes to the stress test with the stress capital buffer.",JOHN HELTMAN.
328,Are these kind of the—are there any new frontiers of regulatory changes that you are envisioning or are you just—are you kind of done for the time being?,JOHN HELTMAN.
329,Or what else can we expect from the Fed?,JOHN HELTMAN.
330,It’s actually a pretty full docket right now.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
331,"You mentioned a number of the things, but I would—I would point out—we’re having, I guess, a public Board meeting tomorrow on the single counterparty credit limit provision.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
332,We’ve also got quite a lot of work to promulgate rules to—after S. 2155 that Senator Crapo’s bill passed—we’ve got a lot of work to do under that.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
333,"We’ve got to think about how we would reach below that $250 billion threshold to assess and supervise, regulate, you know, financial stability risks below that level.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
334,So what am I missing?,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
335,"There’s—there—oh, oh, net stable funding ratio is out there to be done.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
336,"So there’s a lot of work to do, I think.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
337,"You know, and if I can just take this opportunity to say, you know, the financial system all but failed 10 years ago.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
338,"We went to work for 10 years to strengthen it—stronger capital, stronger liquidity, stress testing, resolution planning.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
339,We want to keep all that stuff.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
340,"We want to make it, you know, even more effective and certainly more efficient.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
341,We want to tailor those regulations for institutions.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
342,We want the strongest provisions to apply to the most systemically important institutions.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
343,And so we’re committed to preserving and enhancing that structure.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
344,"But we—we’re finding a lot that we can do in the way of tailoring regulations for the smaller, less systemically important institutions, and that’s a lot of what we’re working on right now.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
345,Thank you.,GREG ROBB.
346,You said at the beginning of your press conference that you plan to be more plainspoken.,GREG ROBB.
347,"And so, okay, I wanted to know what you would say to workers who are worried that, you know, these paths of rate hikes that you’ve laid out will kind of undercut the wage growth they are just starting to see.",GREG ROBB.
348,Thank you.,GREG ROBB.
349,"You know, I would say that the economy is in great shape.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
350,"If you look at household surveys, confidence is high.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
351,"Look at businesses, confidence is high.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
352,"If you ask—if you survey workers about the job market, they’ll say that it’s a really good environment to find jobs.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
353,"If you survey businesses, they’ll say that workers are scarce.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
354,"So I think overall, we have—we have a really solid economy on our hands here.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
355,"And so what we’re doing is, we are trying to conduct monetary policy in a way that will sustain that expansion, keep the labor markets strong, and keep inflation above—right at—sorry, not above, but right at 2 percent.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
356,"That’s really what we’re trying to do and, you know, I would say I like the results so far.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
357,"We’re—we’ve been very, very careful not to tighten too quickly.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
358,I think we’ve been patient.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
359,I think that patience has borne fruit and I think it continues to.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
360,We had a lot of encouragement to go much faster and I’m really glad we didn’t.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
361,"But, at this time, the—continuing on that gradual pace seems—continues to seem like the right thing.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
362,"If we get a sense that the economy is reacting badly, then we’ll certainly react to that.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
363,"Hi, David Harrison with Dow Jones Newswires.",DAVID HARRISON.
364,Where do you see the neutral interest rate is right now?,DAVID HARRISON.
365,Do you think it’s—do you see it sort of inching up because of the recent fiscal stimulus measures?,DAVID HARRISON.
366,And how will you know when we’re getting close to that neutral point?,DAVID HARRISON.
367,"So if—you know, if inflation stays around 2, it doesn’t go above 2 for a while, do you see a need to actually exceed that neutral point?",DAVID HARRISON.
368,"So I would just point you to the range of estimates at the Committee, which I think is 2¼ to 3½, and the median is 2.9, right in there.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
369,So that’s the range of estimates of the nominal neutral rate of interest.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
370,"And we do understand that there’s high uncertainty around the level, but that’s kind of—so you can think of 2.9 as being—which is sort of a full percentage point away from where fed funds is going to trade after today’s decision.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
371,"You asked, is the—is the neutral rate moving up because of fiscal policy?",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
372,Yes.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
373,"I mean, there’s—there should be an effect if you have increased deficits that should put upward pressure on, you know, a few tenths, let’s say.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
374,"Again, though, they were estimating these things.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
375,It’s one of these unobserved variables so it’s very hard to—we shouldn’t try to speak about it with a—with a lot of precision or confidence.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
376,"But, yes, that should put upward pressure on it.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
377,How will we know?,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
378,"Well, I think you have to look at inflation.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
379,"You’ve got to look at—you’ve got to look at all of the indicators in the economy and look at inflation, look at unemployment, look at what’s happening in the job market.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
380,And inflation is really important.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
381,It’s worth noting that the last two business cycles didn’t end with high inflation—they ended with financial instability—so that’s something we need to also keep our eye on.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
382,Virginie Montet with Agence France-Presse.,VIRGINIE MONTET.
383,Have you talked during the meeting about when the Fed is going to remove or change the word “accommodative” that describe the monetary policy for almost 10 years?,VIRGINIE MONTET.
384,And could this change in the vocabulary make the market nervous?,VIRGINIE MONTET.
385,And have you thought already at some options so to know how you’re going to call it down the road?,VIRGINIE MONTET.
386,"Yes, that is—that is something that we discuss.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
387,We look at all the language.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
388,"As you know, we made a—we made a significant number of changes at this meeting.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
389,"So language gets in the statement and then, you know, the economy changes.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
390,That’s what happens.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
391,We really—our approach to policy hasn’t changed.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
392,"And, you know, as I mentioned earlier, for a long time, the economy has needed accommodative monetary policy.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
393,"As the economy has recovered, we’ve been gradually raising rates and we will—we will be at a place relatively soon when, again, assuming we stay on this path, when interest rates will be in the zone of what FOMC participants think is roughly neutral.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
394,"And, at that point, it would no longer be accurate for us to say that the Committee thinks that policy is accommodative.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
395,We know that’s coming.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
396,"We kind of don’t think it’s here yet, but it’s certainly coming.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
397,And I think that the market will understand that.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
398,"I mean, the real message is that you’re getting close to the neutral rate.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
399,It’s a characterization about where policy is.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
400,"It’s not a statement, really, that should upset the markets.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
401,"But, you know, we’ll obviously discuss it carefully in meetings and communicate about it.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
402,So.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
403,Thank you very much.,NAOATSU AOYAMA.
404,"Naoatsu Aoyama from the Asahi Shimbun, Japan’s newspaper.",NAOATSU AOYAMA.
405,"Would you expand on the—on your views on the downside risks—downside risks, especially in regard to trade issues?",NAOATSU AOYAMA.
406,Many people are—in the key allies of the United States—are concerned that the United States may destabilize the underpinnings of the international liberal order the United States has created and built up in the postwar environment.,NAOATSU AOYAMA.
407,"So—and that will, of course, have a very negative economic implications for the global economy as well as the U.S. economy.",NAOATSU AOYAMA.
408,So would you—have you—can I have your views on that?,NAOATSU AOYAMA.
409,Sure.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
410,"So, you know, as I mentioned earlier, I’m really committed to staying in our lane on things.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
411,"We have very important jobs assigned to us by Congress and that’s maximum employment, stable prices, financial stability.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
412,Trade is explicitly assigned to the executive branch by Congress and not to us.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
413,So we don’t really—we don’t really seek to play a role in trade policy.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
414,We’re not at that table.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
415,Those are—those powers and decisions are given to others and so we want to stick to what we do.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
416,"And, you know, I—as I mentioned earlier, we do hear from our business contacts, which are extensive in the United States, and we do report on that in the minutes, and I’ve just mentioned what those are.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
417,There is —there is concern that trade changes could be disruptive.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
418,"And I also—as I also mentioned, we don’t see it in the numbers yet.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
419,We really don’t.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
420,We see a very strong economy across a bunch of fronts.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
421,"It hasn’t reached everyone, let’s be clear on that.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
422,But most people who want a job can find one.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
423,"We’re well aware that there are pockets out there of people who have not felt the recession yet, but, broadly speaking, it’s a good economy.1 STEVEN BECKNER.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
424,"Steve Beckner, Mr. Chairman, freelance journalist reporting for NPR.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
425,"About financial conditions, which worries you more—warnings that rising short-term rates are bringing the yield curve closer to inversion, or the fact that long rates have risen very slowly and, in fact, are nearly 20 basis points below their recent high?",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
426,How do you account for the fact that long rates have been so slow to rise?,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
427,And what does it say about the inflation outlook as well?,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
428,So let me—let me briefly mention the yield curve.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
429,"I mean, I—the yield curve is something that people are talking about a lot, including FOMC participants.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
430,And I—you have a range of views.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
431,It’s something we’re going to continue to be talking about.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
432,"It’s—but it’s only one of many things, of course, that we talk about.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
433,"I think that that discussion is really about what is appropriate policy, and how do we think about policy as we approach the neutral rate.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
434,How do we understand what the neutral rate is?,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
435,How do we know where it is?,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
436,And what are the consequences of being above or below it?,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
437,"That’s really what—when people are talking about the slope of the yield curve, that’s really what they’re talking about.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
438,We know why—we know why the yield curve is flattening.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
439,It’s because we’re raising the federal funds rate.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
440,It makes all the sense in the world that the short end would come up.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
441,"I think you asked—the harder question is, what’s happening with long rates?",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
442,And there are many things that move long rates around.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
443,"Of course, there’s an embedded expectation of the path of short rates.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
444,"There’s the term premium, which has been very low by historical standards.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
445,And so arguments are made that a flatter yield curve has less of a signal embedded in it.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
446,In                                                  1 Chairman Powell intended to say that there are pockets of people in the United States who have not yet experienced the economic recovery.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
447,"addition, I think what you saw most recently that you referred to, Steve, was just risk-on, risk-off.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
448,"In a risk-off environment, people want to own U.S. Treasuries, and you see—you know, Treasury prices go up, rates go down quite a lot.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
449,"So—but I think ultimately, you know, what we’re—what we really care about is what’s the appropriate stance of policy.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
450,"And there’s a—there may be a signal in that long-term rate about what is the neutral rate, and I think that’s why people are paying attention to the yield curve.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
451,Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
452,Companies are buying back their shares at a record rate.,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
453,Corporate debt is up.,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
454,Consumer debt is rising.,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
455,Are we in a credit bubble?,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
456,Is that something that you’re worried about?,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
457,"So if you look at households, you do not see excess credit growth, you don’t see high levels of credit going out.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
458,So not so much households.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
459,"And that really was where the problems were before the financial crisis, was particularly in—among household borrowing, particularly around mortgages.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
460,"With—if you take banks, then, of course, their leverage is significantly lower.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
461,"Or, to say it differently, their capital is significantly higher.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
462,"If you ask about nonfinancial corporates, that’s really where leverage is at levels that are high relative to history.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
463,"But defaults are low, interest rates are low, you know, so it’s something—that’s something we’re watching very carefully.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
464,"But, again, I don’t think we see it as—I think there are a range of views on that, but we are watching nonfinancial corporates.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
465,"Households are in good shape, though, and that is—that is so important because that’s where—you know, that’s where we got into trouble before.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
466,"And that’s—it’s often around property, and particularly housing, where you see real problems emerge.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
467,"We don’t really see that now, so we take some solace from that.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
468,Myles Udland with Yahoo Finance.,MYLES UDLAND.
469,"Chair Powell, you referenced a minute ago this idea of cushion, or the fact that the Fed doesn’t have as much of when rates are low and inflation is low.",MYLES UDLAND.
470,"And I’m wondering if you or the Committee has thought about your move to raise interest rates as partly responding to the economy, but partly giving yourselves room to navigate in the inevitable future recession, whenever that was to come.",MYLES UDLAND.
471,"And do you think that that has played any part in, you know, your outlook for policy or recent policy decisions?",MYLES UDLAND.
472,"Or is it, you know, just a purely based on what the economy is doing?",MYLES UDLAND.
473,So it doesn’t play any part in my thinking and I’ll tell you why.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
474,"If you raise rates too quickly, you’re just increasing the likelihood of a recession, and that’s exactly what you don’t want to do.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
475,"So the best thing you can do, I think—I think the incentives actually run in the other direction.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
476,"If you’re—if you’re worried about going back to the lower bound, then risk management would suggest that you go a little slower in raising rates and tolerate—that’s likely to be a more sustainable strategy to get further away from the zero lower bound.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
477,"I think we’re far enough away now, though, that the risks are kind of balanced.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
478,"And so I think it’s more just—we’re just looking at the economy, and what does it need, and how do we—how do we sustain the expansion, keep the labor market strong, and try to keep inflation near 2 percent?",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
479,Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.,MARK HAMRICK.
480,You talked earlier about wage growth and your basic message to workers.,MARK HAMRICK.
481,"How confident are you that when we do see stock buybacks and the like, the workers will get whatever your view of that share is as well and the wage hikes in the near term and in the foreseeable future?",MARK HAMRICK.
482,Thank you.,MARK HAMRICK.
483,"You know, we don’t—we don’t have the tools to control that.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
484,If companies choose to—companies in our system are free to do what they can—what they need to do once they’ve—once they’ve made profits and have cash to distribute.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
485,"They can distribute it to their shareholders, they can buy—either through dividends or through buybacks.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
486,They can pay their workers.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
487,"You know, the part—and, you know, we don’t play a role in those decisions.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
488,The part that we focus on is maximum employment.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
489,That’s our mandate.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
490,"So we view maximum employment as the maximum sustainable level of employment, meaning it’s not so much that it will cause the economy to overheat.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
491,And so I think we’ve been committed to that.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
492,I think we take that obligation very seriously.,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
493,"And, you know, over time, when—when labor markets are strong and companies are hiring, we should see higher wages.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
494,"But, again, we don’t really have the tools that will address the distribution of profits and that kind of thing.",CHAIRMAN POWELL.
