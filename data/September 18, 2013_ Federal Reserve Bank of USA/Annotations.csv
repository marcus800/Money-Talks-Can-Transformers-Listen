0,(FOMC) concluded a two-day meeting earlier today.,None
1,"As you already know from our statement, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and to make no change in either its asset purchase program or its forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate target.",None
2,I will discuss the rationales for our decision in a moment.,None
3,"Economic growth has generally been proceeding at a moderate pace, with continued—albeit somewhat uneven—improvement in labor market conditions.",None
4,"Of course, to say that the job market has improved does not imply that current conditions are satisfactory.",None
5,"Notably, at 7.3 percent, the unemployment rate remains well above acceptable levels.",None
6,Long-term unemployment and underemployment remain high.,None
7,"And we have seen ongoing declines in labor force participation, which likely reflects discouragement on the part of many potential workers as well as longer-term influences, such as the aging of the population.",None
8,"In the Committee’s assessment, the downside risks to growth have diminished, on net, over the past year, reflecting, among other factors, somewhat better economic and financial conditions in Europe and increased confidence on the part of households and firms in the staying power of the U.S. recovery.",None
9,"However, the tightening of financial conditions observed in recent months, if sustained, could slow the pace of improvement in the economy and the labor market.",None
10,"In addition, federal fiscal policy continues to be an important restraint on growth and a source of downside risk.",None
11,"Apart from some fluctuations due primarily to changes in oil prices, inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-term objective.",None
12,"The Committee unwinding of some transitory factors has led to moderately higher inflation recently, as expected.",None
13,"And, with longer-term inflation expectations well anchored, the Committee anticipates that inflation will gradually move back toward 2 percent.",None
14,"In conjunction with this meeting, the 17 participants in our policy discussions—5 Board members and 12 Reserve Bank presidents—submitted individual economic projections.",None
15,"As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy.",None
16,"Also, at this meeting, we extended the horizon of our projections through 2016.",None
17,"Generally, the projections of individual participants show that they continue to expect moderate economic growth, picking up over time, as well as gradual progress towards levels of unemployment and inflation, consistent with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability.",None
18,"More specifically, participants’ projections for economic growth have a central tendency of 2.0 to 2.3 percent for 2013, rising to 2.9 to 3.1 percent in 2014 and 2.5 to 3.3 percent in 2016.",None
19,"For the unemployment rate, the central tendency of projections for the fourth quarter of each year is 7.1 to 7.3 percent for 2013, declining to 6.4 to 6.8 percent in 2014 and, by 2016, to 5.4 to 5.9 percent—about the longer-run normal level for the unemployment rate.",None
20,Most participants see inflation gradually increasing from its current low level toward the Committee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent.,None
21,"The central tendency of their projections for inflation is 1.1 to 1.2 percent for this year, 1.3 to 1.8 percent for 2014, and 1.7 to 2.0 percent in 2016.",None
22,"With unemployment still elevated and inflation projected to run below the Committee’s term policy interest rate, the federal funds rate.",None
23,"However, the target range for the federal funds rate, currently at 0 to ¼ percent, cannot be lowered meaningfully further.",None
24,"Accordingly, the Committee has been providing policy support to the economy through two complementary methods:  by purchasing and holding Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities and by communicating the Committee’s plans for setting the federal funds rate target over the medium term.",None
25,"I’ll discuss these tools in turn, beginning with our program of asset purchases.",None
26,"In September 2012, the FOMC initiated a program of purchasing $40 billion per month in agency mortgage-backed securities, in addition to the $45 billion per month in longer-term Treasury securities that we were already acquiring as part of our maturity extension program.",None
27,"We stated that, subject to our ongoing assessment of the efficacy and costs of the program, purchases would continue until we saw a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability.",None
28,"In December 2012, we announced that we would continue to purchase $45 billion per month in longer-term Treasuries after the maturity extension program ended later that month.",None
29,"Thus, our total purchases of longer-term securities were maintained at $85 billion per month, in addition to the reinvestment or rolling over of maturing securities on our balance sheet.",None
30,"The Committee agreed today to continue asset purchases at that rate, subject to the same conditions that we laid out a year ago.",None
31,"Because the Committee tied its asset purchases to the outlook for the labor market, it’s important to assess how that outlook has evolved.",None
32,"As I noted earlier, conditions in the job market today are still far from what all of us would like to see.",None
33,"Nevertheless, meaningful progress has been made in the year since we announced the asset purchase program.",None
34,For period.,None
35,"Over the past 12 months, aggregate hours of work are up by about 2.4 percent, weekly new claims for unemployment insurance have fallen by about 50,000, and surveys suggest that households perceive jobs as more readily available.",None
36,"Importantly, these gains were achieved despite substantial fiscal headwinds, which are likely slowing economic growth this year by a percentage point, or more, and reducing employment by hundreds of thousands of jobs.",None
37,"Not all labor market developments over the past year were positive, however; notably, the labor force participation rate fell by about 0.3 percentage points and real wages remained about flat.",None
38,"In light of this cumulative progress, the FOMC concluded at our June meeting that the criterion of substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market might well be met over the subsequent year or so.",None
39,"Accordingly, the Committee sought to provide more guidance on how the pace of purchases might be adjusted over time.",None
40,"The Committee anticipated in June that, subject to certain conditions, it might be appropriate to begin to moderate the pace of purchases later this year, continuing to reduce the pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half of next year, and ending purchases around midyear 2014.",None
41,"However, we also made clear at that time that adjustments to the pace of purchases would depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook—in particular, on the receipt of evidence supporting the Committee’s expectation that gains in the labor market will be sustained and that inflation is moving back towards its 2 percent objective over time.",None
42,"At the meeting concluded earlier today, the sense of the Committee was that the broad contours of the medium-term economic outlook—including economic growth sufficient to support ongoing gains in the labor market, and inflation moving towards its objective—were economic data do not yet provide sufficient confirmation of its baseline outlook to warrant such a reduction.",None
43,"Moreover, the Committee has some concern that the rapid tightening of financial conditions in recent months could have the effect of slowing growth, as I noted earlier, a concern that would be exacerbated if conditions tightened further.",None
44,"Finally, the extent of the effects of restrictive fiscal policies remain unclear, and upcoming fiscal debates may involve additional risks to financial markets and to the broader economy.",None
45,"In light of these uncertainties, the Committee decided to await more evidence that the recovery’s progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of asset purchases.",None
46,"The Committee will, of course, continue to monitor economic and financial developments closely.",None
47,"As noted in today’s statement, in judging when to moderate the pace of asset purchases, the Committee will, at its coming meetings, assess whether incoming information continues to support the Committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back towards its longer-run objective.",None
48,"However, as we have said, and as today’s decision underscores, asset purchases are not on a preset course.",None
49,The Committee’s decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the economic outlook and on the Committee’s ongoing assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of the program.,None
50,Let me turn now to the FOMC’s forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate.,None
51,"The Committee again reaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally low range for the funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, so long as inflation and inflation expectations remain well behaved as described in our statement.",None
52,"As I have noted frequently, the economic conditions we have set out as preceding any future rate would, instead, indicate only that it had become appropriate for the Committee to consider whether the broader economic outlook justified such an increase.",None
53,"The Committee would be unlikely to increase rates if inflation were projected to remain below our 2 percent objective for some time, for example; and, in making its assessment, the Committee would also take into account additional measures of labor market conditions, such as job gains.",None
54,"Thus, the first increases in short-term rates might not occur until the unemployment rate is considerably below 6½ percent.",None
55,The projections of the path of the federal funds rate by individual Committee participants are generally consistent with this guidance.,None
56,"Although the central tendency of the projected unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of next year encompasses 6½ percent, 12 of the 17 participants expect the first rate increase to take place in 2015 and two expect it to occur in 2016.",None
57,Most participants also see the funds rate target rising only very slowly after the process of removing policy accommodation begins.,None
58,The median projected funds rate for the end of 2015 is 1 percent.,None
59,"And notably, although the central tendencies of the projections for both inflation and the unemployment rate in 2016 are close to the longer-run normal values for those variables, the median projection for the federal funds rate at the end of 2016 is 2 percent, well below the longer-run normal value for the federal funds rate of 4 percent or so projected by most participants.",None
60,"Committee participants generally believe that, because the headwinds to recovery will abate only gradually, achieving and maintaining maximum employment and price stability will require a patient policy approach that involves keeping the target for the federal funds rate policy—asset purchases and forward guidance about short-term interest rates—the overall stance of monetary policy is what matters for growth, jobs, and inflation.",None
61,"Our program of asset purchases was set up a year ago to help achieve a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in the context of price stability, relative to conditions when the program was initiated, and we have made progress toward meeting that criterion.",None
62,"However, even after asset purchases are wound down—which we will do in a manner that is both deliberate and dependent on the incoming economic data—the Federal Reserve’s rates guidance and its ongoing holdings of securities will ensure that monetary policy remains highly accommodative, consistent with an aggressive pursuit of our mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability.",None
63,"Thank you, and I’d be glad to take your questions.",None
64,"Thanks, Mr. Chairman.",PEDRO DA COSTA.
65,Pedro da Costa from Reuters.,PEDRO DA COSTA.
66,You cite meaningful progress on the labor market both on the unemployment front and in terms of payroll growth.,PEDRO DA COSTA.
67,"But much of the decline in the unemployment rate has been due, as you know, to the decline in participation.",PEDRO DA COSTA.
68,"So my question to you is—and also on the payroll front, some people would argue that, while there has been growth, it hasn’t been strong enough to keep up with population growth and make up the gap that we have from the recession.",PEDRO DA COSTA.
69,"So, how high do you think the jobless rate would be if it were not for the decline in participation?",PEDRO DA COSTA.
70,I’ve heard estimates as high as 10 to 11 percent.,PEDRO DA COSTA.
71,And could you put the labor market in that context?,PEDRO DA COSTA.
72,Certainly.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
73,"So, I think there is a cyclical component to participation, and, in that respect, the unemployment rate understates the amount of sort of true unemployment, if you will, in the economy.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
74,"But on the other hand, there is also a downward in the labor force—other factors which aren’t really related to this recession.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
75,"Over the last year, the unemployment rate has dropped by eight-tenths of a percentage point.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
76,"The participation rate has dropped by three-tenths of a percentage point, which is pretty close to the trend.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
77,"So, in other words, I think it would be fair to say that most of the improvement in the unemployment rate—not all, but most of it in the last year—is due to job creation rather than lower participation.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
78,"I would also note that if you look at the broader measures of unemployment that the BLS publishes, including part-time work, including discouraged workers and so on, you’ll see that those rates have fallen about the same amount as the overall standard civilian unemployment rate.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
79,"So I think that there has been progress, and it’s obscured to some extent by the downward trend in participation.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
80,"But I also would agree with you that the unemployment rate, while perhaps the best single indicator of the state of labor market, is not by itself a fully representative indicator.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
81,"Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times.",BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.
82,To what extent do you regard yourself as responsible for the tightening in financial conditions that you noted?,BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.
83,Was it a mistake to talk about tapering in the way that you did in June and do you stand by your guidance that it will be appropriate?,BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.
84,Do you still expect that it will be appropriate to dial down asset purchases by the end of this year?,BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.
85,"So to answer the first part of your question, I think there’s no alternative in making monetary policy but to communicate as clearly as possible, and that’s what we tried to do.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
86,"As of June, we had made meaningful progress in labor market conditions, and the Committee thought that was the time to begin talking about how the eventual wind-down wind-down to take place and which, in turn, was also fully contingent on the ratification—so to speak—of our outlook, which included continued improvements in the labor market.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
87,"So all of that was very consistent with what we said when we began the program, that our goal was to achieve a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, and we needed to communicate how that was going to be put into practice.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
88,"Failing to communicate that information would have risked creating a large divergence between market expectations, public expectations, and what the Committee intentions were, and that could have led to much more serious problems down the road.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
89,So I think the communication was very important.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
90,"The general framework—to answer the other part of your question, the general framework in which we’re operating is still the same.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
91,"We have a three-part baseline projection, which involves increasing growth that’s picking up over time as fiscal drag is reduced, continuing gains in the labor market, and inflation moving back towards objective.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
92,"We are looking to see—in the coming meetings, we’ll be looking to see if the data confirm that basic outlook.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
93,"If it does, we’ll take a first step at some point—possibly later this year—and then continue so long as the data are consistent with that continued progress.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
94,And so that basic structure is still in place.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
95,But what I want to emphasize is really two things.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
96,"First, as I’ve said, asset purchases are not on a preset course, they are conditional on the data.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
97,They’ve always been conditional on the data.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
98,"And, secondly, that even as we move from asset purchases to rate policy as the principal tool of monetary policy, it’s our intent to maintain a highly accommodative policy and to provide Binya’s question, Mr. Chairman, you said that you could pull back the purchases possibly later this year.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
99,You sound a little bit less certain that it’s going to happen later this year.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
100,"So I’d like you—to ask you to talk a little bit more about your conviction about whether these are like—the pullback is likely to start this year, where do you stand on that?",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
101,And I also don’t think I heard you mentioned that 7 percent unemployment number that you’ve talked—you talked about back in June.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
102,That was the rate that was—the unemployment rate that was supposed to prevail when the Fed was done doing this.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
103,Is that no longer operative?,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
104,"So there is no fixed calendar—schedule, I really have to emphasize that.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
105,"If the data confirm our basic outlook, if we gain more confidence in that outlook and we believe that the three-part test that I mentioned is indeed coming to pass, then we could move later this year, we could begin later this year.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
106,"But even if we do that, the subsequent steps will be dependent on continued progress in the economy.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
107,So we are tied to the data—we don’t have a fixed calendar schedule—but we do have the same basic framework that I described in June.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
108,The criterion for ending the asset purchases program is a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
109,"Last time, I gave 7 percent as an indicative number to give you some sense of, you know, where that might be.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
110,"But, as my first answer suggested, the unemployment rate is not necessarily a great measure, in all circumstances, of the state of the labor market overall.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
111,"For example, just last month, the decline in the unemployment rate came about more than entirely because of declining participation, not because of increased jobs.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
112,So are shooting for.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
113,We’re looking for overall improvement in the labor market.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
114,"Steve Liesman, with CNBC.",STEVE LIESMAN.
115,"Mr. Chairman, one question—just three parts, if you don’t mind.",STEVE LIESMAN.
116,Have you indicated to President Obama you did not want to serve a third term?,STEVE LIESMAN.
117,"If so, when?",STEVE LIESMAN.
118,Or did President Obama indicate to you he did not want you to serve a third term?,STEVE LIESMAN.
119,"And those two parts notwithstanding, would you serve a third term if asked, either wholly or in part?",STEVE LIESMAN.
120,Thank you.,STEVE LIESMAN.
121,"Well, it’s convenient because I have the same answer to all three parts of your question.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
122,"If you will indulge me just a little longer, I prefer not to talk about my plans at this point.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
123,"I hope to have more information for you at some reasonably soon date, but today I want to focus on monetary policy.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
124,I’d prefer not to talk about my own plans.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
125,"Ylan Mui, Washington Post.",YLAN MUI.
126,You mentioned that tighter fiscal conditions are a concern for the Committee as you guys think about whether or not it’s appropriate to reduce asset purchases.,YLAN MUI.
127,"What do you all expect to be able to do in the future, when you actually do begin to pull back in your asset purchases, to manage expectations and manage the market reactions such that we don’t see another increase in rates?",YLAN MUI.
128,What’s the relationship between the pullback and fiscal policy?,CHAIRMAN BERNAKE.
129,"Oh, I’m sorry.",YLAN MUI.
130,"I meant financial conditions, tighter financial conditions.",YLAN MUI.
131,"Oh, tighter financial conditions, sure.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
132,"Well, I think part of the reaction we’ve seen—and it comes from a number of sources—part of it comes from improved economic news and that’s part of the reason why rates have gone up in other countries monetary policy, and that we want to make sure we get straight.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
133,"And that’s why—to answer the earlier question, again, it’s why communication is so important.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
134,"We need to explain, as best we can, how we’re going to move and on what basis we’re going to move.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
135,"It’s much more difficult today than it was 20 years ago because the tools are more complex so they’re less familiar, but that’s still very important.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
136,"I think the other factor which was at play was an unwinding of excessively risky and levered positions in the markets, and insufficiencies of liquidity in some cases meant that those unwindings led to larger reactions in prices and rates than might otherwise have occurred.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
137,"Now, the tightening associated with that is, to some extent, unwelcome, but, on the other hand, to the extent that some of the riskier, more levered positions have been eliminated, I think that makes the situation more sustainable and reduces, at least, the risk that there will be an over-strong reaction to further announcements.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
138,So we will do our best to communicate clearly.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
139,That is our goal and our objective.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
140,"The more clearly we communicate, the better the chance that markets will understand our intentions and that we can avoid any sharp movements.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
141,"But, again, we’re dealing with tools that are less familiar, harder to quantify, and harder to communicate about than the traditional funds rate.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
142,"Robin Harding, from the Financial Times.",ROBIN HARDING.
143,"Mr. Chairman, the median Committee member expects a 2 percent interest rate at the end of 2016, and, in the long run, they expect interest rates to return to 4 percent.",ROBIN HARDING.
144,Can you give us any sense of when you and when the Committee expect interest rates to get back to that 4 percent figure?,ROBIN HARDING.
145,"Let me first restate the—I think the key point here, which is estimate that the appropriate target for the federal funds rate at the end of 2016 will be around 2 percent, even though at that time the economy should be close to full employment, according to our best projections.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
146,"The reason for that—there may be possibly several reasons, but we did discuss this in the Committee today—the primary reason for that low value is that we expect that a number of factors—including the slow recovery of the housing sector, continued fiscal drag, perhaps continued effects from the financial crisis—may still prove to be headwinds to the recovery.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
147,"And even though we can achieve full employment, doing so will be done by using rates lower than, sort of, the long-run normal.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
148,"So, in other words, in economics terms, the equilibrium rate, the rate that achieves full employment, looks like it will be lower for a time because of these headwinds that will be slowing aggregate demand growth.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
149,"So that’s why we expect to see growth that—I mean, rates at an unusually low level.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
150,I imagine it would take a few more years after that to get to the 4 percent level.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
151,"I couldn’t be much more precise than that—I mean, we’re already obviously stretching the bounds of credibility to talk about specific projections to 2016.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
152,But I think you would expect to see that rates would gradually rise for the two or three years after 2016 and ultimately get to 4 percent.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
153,"Mr. Chairman, Josh Zumbrun from Bloomberg News.",JOSH ZUMBRUN.
154,"You indicated that you can see the Fed lowering the pace of purchases once the economy starts to grow faster, in line with what the Fed’s projected.",JOSH ZUMBRUN.
155,"For about the past four years, the Fed has been projecting that growth would quicken to about 3 percent, and it never has.",JOSH ZUMBRUN.
156,"So, at what point are you decide—going to decide that other costs and benefits are the reason that you’re making the decision?",JOSH ZUMBRUN.
157,Are we getting close to that having to be a deciding factor even if you don’t get the mean that you need a press conference to make a tapering decision?,JOSH ZUMBRUN.
158,"Well, you’re certainly right that we have been over-optimistic about out-year growth.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
159,There are a number of reasons for that.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
160,"One reason for it, though, is that it appears—and I talked about this in a speech last year—it appears that, as part of the aftermath of the financial crisis, that, at least temporarily, the potential growth rate of the economy has been slowed, perhaps because new businesses are not being formed at the same rate, innovation may not be translated into new technologies at the same rate, investment is slower, et cetera.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
161,"So it appears, again, that the potential rate of growth of the economy has been slowed somewhat, at least temporarily, by the recession and the financial crisis, and you can see that in the slower productivity figures.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
162,"Now, we have—you know, we haven’t anticipated that slowdown in productivity, and that’s one of the main reasons why we haven’t anticipated the relatively slow growth.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
163,"Now, it’s important to recognize though that what monetary policy affects is not the potential rate of growth, long-run rate of growth, but rather the cyclical part, the deviation of output and employment from its normal level.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
164,"And in predicting the amount of slack in the economy, so to speak, we’ve done a little better.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
165,"Our predictions of unemployment, for example, have been better than our predictions of growth.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
166,"And, in particular, one thing that’s been quite striking is that unemployment—we were too pessimistic on unemployment for this year.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
167,Unemployment has fallen faster than we anticipated.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
168,"So, in that respect, we were too pessimistic rather than too optimistic.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
169,"So, we’ll continue to do the best we can.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
170,"We’re looking, again, to see confirmation towards target, and that’s what will determine our policy decisions.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
171,"In terms of press conferences, I think it’s important to say that there’s an understanding in the Committee that we’ve had for a while, that there are eight “real” meetings every year—that every meeting is a meeting in which any policy decision can be taken.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
172,"And, should anything occur at a meeting without a scheduled press conference that requires additional explanation, we certainly could arrange a public, on-the-record conference call or some other way of answering the media’s questions.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
173,Greg Ip of the Economist.,GREG IP.
174,"You said that you—the Committee would be unlikely to raise the federal funds rate if inflation remains below target, but your own projections have inflation—that’s the midpoint of your inflation projections—below your 2 percent target through 2016.",GREG IP.
175,So is that inconsistent with the liftoff in the federal funds rate in that period?,GREG IP.
176,"And, related, is there a case to be made that your thresholds should be supplemented with a lower bound for the inflation rate—i.e., you won’t tighten if inflation is at or below some lower bound?",GREG IP.
177,"So on the latter part, you know, of course, you’re seeing interest rate projections and inflation projections separately.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
178,You’re not seeing them combined by individuals.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
179,Each individual is making their own projection.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
180,"I think you’re right, I mean, that we should be very reluctant to raise rates if inflation remains persistently below target, and that’s one of the reasons that I think we can be very patient in raising the federal funds rate since we have not seen any inflation pressure.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
181,"On having an inflation floor, that would be in addition to the guidance.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
182,We are given that we do have a target.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
183,"And, of course, implicit in our policy strategy is trying to reach that target for inflation, but that—an inflation floor is certainly something that, you know, could be a sensible modification or addition to the guidance.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
184,VICTORIA McGRANE.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
185,"Victoria McGrane, Dow Jones Newswires.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
186,Many investors were expecting the Fed to move at least a little bit in pulling back the bond-buying program today.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
187,"Given that you all decided not to do that, are—do you have any concerns that, once again, the Fed is confusing investors and sending mixed signals?",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
188,"Well, I don’t recall stating that we would do any particular thing in this meeting.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
189,What we are going to do is the right thing for the economy.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
190,"And our assessment of the data since June is that, taken collectively, that it didn’t quite meet the standard of satisfying our—or of ratifying or confirming our basic outlook for, again, increasing growth, improving labor markets, and inflation moving back towards target.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
191,We try our best to communicate to markets—we’ll continue to do that—but we can’t let market expectations dictate our policy actions.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
192,Our policy actions have to be determined by our best assessment of what’s needed for the economy.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
193,"Peter Barnes, Fox Business, sir.",PETER BARNES.
194,You mentioned fiscal issues in the statement today.,PETER BARNES.
195,Are you concerned about a government shutdown?,PETER BARNES.
196,We’re hearing more about that possibility.,PETER BARNES.
197,Did that come up in your discussions at this meeting?,PETER BARNES.
198,"What do you think would be the impact of a government shutdown on the economy, and what could the Fed’s—or, would the Fed be prepared to respond to that and help the economy with additional accommodation, for some upcoming fiscal policy decisions.",PETER BARNES.
199,"I would include both the possibility of a government shutdown, but also the debt limit issue.",PETER BARNES.
200,"These are obviously, you know, part of a very complicated set of legislative decisions, strategies, battles, et cetera, which I won’t get into.",PETER BARNES.
201,"But it is the case, I think, that a government shutdown—and perhaps, even more so, a failure to raise the debt limit—could have very serious consequences for the financial markets and for the economy, and the Federal Reserve’s policy is to do whatever we can to keep the economy on course.",PETER BARNES.
202,"And so, if these actions led the economy to slow, then we would have to take that into account, surely.",PETER BARNES.
203,So this is one of the risks that we are looking at as we think about policy.,PETER BARNES.
204,"That being said, you know, again, our ability to offset these shocks is very limited, particularly a debt limit shock.",PETER BARNES.
205,"And I think it’s extraordinarily important that Congress and the Administration work together to find a way to make sure that the government is funded, public services are provided, that the government pays its bills, and that we avoid any kind of event like 2011, which had, at least for a time, a noticeable adverse effect on confidence and on the economy.",PETER BARNES.
206,"Annalyn Kurtz, with CNNMoney.",ANNALYN KURTZ.
207,"This week marks five years since the financial crisis began, and Hank Paulson, who you’ve worked very closely with, has said his biggest regret was that he wasn’t able to convince the American people that what was done— the bank bailouts—weren’t for Wall Street, they were for Main Street.",ANNALYN KURTZ.
208,What is your biggest regret as you reflect on the five-year anniversary?,ANNALYN KURTZ.
209,"And do you believe that the Fed, Congress, and the President have put the necessary measures in place to prevent another deep financial crisis?",ANNALYN KURTZ.
210,"Well, on regrets, as Frank Sinatra says, I have many.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
211,"I we could, given the powers that we had, and I would agree with Hank that we were motivated entirely by the interest of the broader public, that our goal was to stabilize the financial system so that it would not bring the economy down, so that it would not create massive unemployment and economic hardship that was even more—that would have been even more severe by many times than what we actually saw.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
212,So I agree with him on that.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
213,"And I guess, since you gave me the opportunity, I would mention that, of course, all the money that was used in those operations has been paid back with interest.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
214,"And so, it hasn’t been costly, even from a fiscal point of view.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
215,"Now, in terms of progress, that’s a good question.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
216,I think we’ve made a lot of progress.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
217,"We had, of course, the Dodd–Frank law passed in 2010, and then we recently, you know, have come to agreement internationally on a number of measures, including Basel III and other agreements relating to the shadow banking system and other aspects of the financial system.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
218,"I think that our—today, our large financial firms, for example, are better capitalized by far than they were certainly during the crisis and even before the crisis.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
219,Supervision is tougher.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
220,"We do stress testing to make sure that firms can withstand not only normal shocks, but very, very large shocks, similar to those they experienced in 2008.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
221,"And, very importantly, of course, we now have a tool that we didn’t have in 2008—which would have made, I think, a significant difference if we had had it—which is the orderly liquidation authority that the Dodd–Frank bill gave to the FDIC in collaboration with the Fed.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
222,"Under the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC, with other agencies, has the ability to wind down a failing financial firm in a way that minimizes the direct impact on the financial markets and on the economy.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
223,"Now, I should say, I don’t want to overstate the case—I think there’s a lot more work to resolution regimes, which are very similar to those of the United States, which is going to make for better cooperation across borders.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
224,But we’re still some distance from being fully geared up to work with foreign counterparts to successfully wind down an international—multinational financial firm.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
225,"And that’s—we’ve made progress in that direction, but we need to do more, I think.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
226,"So, I think there’s more to be done.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
227,"There’s more to be done on derivatives, although a lot has been done to make them more transparent and to make the trading of derivatives safer.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
228,"But it’s going to be probably some time before, you know, all of this stuff that has been undertaken, all of these measures are fully implemented.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
229,"And we can assess, you know, the ultimate impact on the financial system.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
230,"Steve Beckner of MNI, Mr. Chairman.",STEVE BECKNER.
231,"A number of economists, and, indeed, some of your Fed colleagues, have argued that the effectiveness of quantitative easing has greatly diminished, if not disappeared, and they point to the recent performance of the economy as proof of that.",STEVE BECKNER.
232,And there have been a number of people who have argued that there are regulatory and other impediments to growth beyond the reach of monetary policy.,STEVE BECKNER.
233,To what extent are these valid arguments?,STEVE BECKNER.
234,"And if the economy does not speed up, if it does not reach your objectives, how will you ever get out of quantitative easing?",STEVE BECKNER.
235,"Well, on the effectiveness of our asset purchases, it’s difficult to get a precise measure.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
236,"There’s a large academic literature on this subject, and they have a range of results, some suggesting that this is a quite powerful tool, some that it’s less powerful.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
237,My own assessment is that it has been effective.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
238,"If you look at the recovery, you see that some of the strongest sectors, the leading sectors like housing and autos, have been interest-been effective.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
239,You mentioned that there hasn’t been any progress.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
240,There has been a lot of progress.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
241,"As I said at the beginning, labor market indicators, while still not where we’d like them to be, are much better today than they were when we began this latest program a year ago.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
242,"And, importantly—as actually is referenced in our FOMC statement—that happened notwithstanding a set of fiscal policies which the CBO said would cost between 1 and 1½ percentage points of real growth and hundreds of thousands of jobs.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
243,"So the fact that we have maintained improvements in the labor market that are as good or better than the previous year, notwithstanding this fiscal drag, is some indication that there is at least a partial offset from monetary policy.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
244,"Now, just as you say, there are a lot of things in the economy that monetary policy can’t address.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
245,"They include the effectiveness of regulation, they include fiscal policy, they include developments in the private sector.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
246,"We do what we can do and what—if we can get help, we’re delighted to have help from other policymakers and from the private sector and we hope that that will happen.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
247,"The criterion for ending asset purchases is not, you know, some very high rate of growth.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
248,"What it is is the criterion—let me just remind you, the criterion is a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, and we have made significant improvement.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
249,"Ultimately, we will reach that level of substantial improvement, and at that point, we will be able to wind down the asset purchases.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
250,"Again, you know, and I think people don’t fully appreciate that we have two tools:  We have asset purchases, and we have rate policy and guidance about rates.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
251,"It’s our view that the latter, the rate policy, is actually the stronger, more reliable tool.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
252,"And when we get to the point where we can, you know, where we are close enough to full monetary background that will allow the economy to continue to grow and move towards full employment.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
253,"Chairman, Donna Borak, with American Banker.",DONNA BORAK.
254,"The Financial Stability Oversight Council has already designated two nonbank firms as SIFIs, as you know, and potentially a third very soon, and presumably others to follow.",DONNA BORAK.
255,"However, little has been said in terms of how specifically these firms will be regulated by the Fed, which has been a chief criticism of the entire process.",DONNA BORAK.
256,"Given that, can you provide us any guidance at this point in terms of how far along the Fed is in terms of letting the banks know how they will be regulated besides, you know, tailoring the plans?",DONNA BORAK.
257,"Well, the two firms that have been designated, AIG and GE Capital, actually are—have been regulated by the Fed, because both of them are savings and loan, thrift holding companies.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
258,So we have a lot of already experience with those firms and a lot of contact with those firms.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
259,We will—I want to use the word “tailored” because we want to design a regime that is appropriate for the business model of the particular firm.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
260,"But our other objective, and what makes designation by the FSOC particularly noteworthy, is that the primary goal of the consolidated supervision by the Fed is to make sure that the firms—the firm doesn’t in any way endanger the stability of the broad financial system.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
261,"So we’ll be looking at not just the usual safety and soundness type matters or supervision, which both can be, again, tailored to the types of assets and liabilities that the firm has, but also we’re going to want to focus on things like resolution authority, practices relating to derivatives and other exposures, interconnectedness, et cetera, to make sure that the firm in its structure and in its operations we already oversee and which we are already subjecting to tougher supervision, higher capital, stress tests, and all the rest.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
262,"Peter Cook of Bloomberg Television, Mr. Chairman.",PETER COOK.
263,"One of my colleagues was remarking as we came in here, we don’t often get surprises from the Federal Reserve.",PETER COOK.
264,"This was a surprise, you talked about—you hadn’t telegraphed anything specifically, but you’ve seen the market reaction, I’m sure.",PETER COOK.
265,"My question for you is, were you intending a surprise today, and did you get the intended result, judging from the market reaction?",PETER COOK.
266,"And related to that, by taking this action today—continuing the bond purchases going forward—at what point do you believe you’re starting to complicate the exit strategy?",PETER COOK.
267,"Simply by continuing to keep the Fed’s foot on the gas pedal, do you make life more complicated for the Federal Reserve down the road?",PETER COOK.
268,"Well, it’s our intention to try to set policy as appropriate for the economy, as I said earlier.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
269,We are somewhat concerned.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
270,"I won’t overstate it, but we do want to see the effects of higher interest rates on the economy, particularly in mortgage rates, on housing.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
271,"So to the extent that our policy makes conditions—our policy decision today makes conditions just a little bit easier, that’s desirable.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
272,"We want to make sure that the economy has adequate support and, in particular, it’s less surprising the market or easing policy as it is avoiding a tightening until we can be comfortable that the economy is in fact growing, you know, the way we want it to be growing.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
273,"So this was a step—it was a step, a precautionary step if you will.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
274,"It was a—the intention is to wait a bit longer and to try to get confirming evidence whether to the—to whether or not the economy is, in fact, conforming to this general outlook variety of tools, and we think we have numerous tools that we—can be used to both manage interest rates and to ultimately unwind the balance sheet when the time comes.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
275,"So I, you know, I’m—I feel quite comfortable that we can—in particular, that we can raise interest rates at the appropriate time, even if the balance sheet remains large for an extended period.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
276,"And that will be true, of course, for, you know, future FOMCs as well.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
277,"Mr. Chairman, Kate Davidson from Politico.",KATE DAVIDSON.
278,"Do you think that all of the recent attention being paid to who will be your replacement has had any immediate effect on the Fed, and could it have any lingering effect on your successor?",KATE DAVIDSON.
279,"And also, do you think the process has just become too politicized, or is this part of a healthy debate?",KATE DAVIDSON.
280,I think the Federal Reserve has strong institutional credibility.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
281,"And it is a strong institution, a highly competent institution, and it’s independent, it’s nonpartisan, and I’m not particularly concerned about the political environment for the Federal Reserve.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
282,"I think the Fed will be—continue to be an important institution in the United States, and that it will maintain its independence going forward.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
283,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",GREG ROBB.
284,"Greg Robb, MarketWatch.",GREG ROBB.
285,"Was there a discussion among the Committee today about changing the forward guidance, the 6.5 percent jobless rate?",GREG ROBB.
286,And could you say why the Committee decided to hold that steady in light of the weaker economy?,GREG ROBB.
287,"Well, as I mentioned earlier, the Committee has regularly reviewed the forward guidance, and there are a number of ways in which the forward guidance could be strengthened.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
288,"For example, Mr. Ip mentioned an inflation floor.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
289,There are other steps think that would be desirable.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
290,"Now, it’s very important that we not take any of these steps lightly, that we make sure we understand all the implications, and that we are comfortable that it will be—that any modifications of the guidance will be credible to markets and to the public.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
291,"So, we continue to think about options.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
292,There are a number of options that we have talked about.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
293,"But today, we—as of today, we didn’t choose to make any changes to the guidance.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
294,"Don Lee, L.A. Times.",DON LEE.
295,"As you may know, the Census Bureau reported yesterday that the poverty rate and the median household income saw no improvement last year.",DON LEE.
296,"And I wonder, when you see median incomes turning up significantly for most people, and in light of the fact that people in the middle and the bottom have seen very little of the gains relative to higher income households, how would you assess the—both quantitative easing and Fed policies?",DON LEE.
297,Sure.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
298,So that’s certainly the case that there are too many people in poverty.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
299,There are a lot of complex issues involved.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
300,"There are complex measurement issues, I would just have to mention that.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
301,There are a lot of issues that are really long-term issues as well.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
302,"For example, it might seem a puzzle that the U.S. economy gets richer and richer, and yet there are more poor people.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
303,"And the explanation, of course, is that our economy is becoming more unequal.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
304,"The more very rich people and more people in the lower half who are not doing well, these are—there’s a lot of reasons behind this trend, which has been going on for decades, and economists disagree about the relative importance of things like technology and international trade and unionization and other factors that have contributed to that.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
305,But I guess my first point is that really by Congress and by the Administration.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
306,"And it’s up to them, I think, to take those steps.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
307,"The Federal Reserve is—we are doing our part to help the median family, the median American, because one of our principal goals—we have two principal goals, one is maximum employment, jobs.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
308,The best way to help families is to create employment opportunities.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
309,"We’re still not satisfied, obviously, with where the labor market, the job market is.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
310,We’ll continue to try to provide support for that.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
311,"And then the other goal is price stability, low inflation, which, of course, also helps make the economy work better for people in the middle and the lower parts of the distribution.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
312,So we use the tools that we have.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
313,"It would be better to have a mix of tools at work—not just monetary policy, but fiscal policy and other policies as well.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
314,"But the Federal Reserve, we can—you know, we only have a certain set of tools, and those are the ones that we use.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
315,"Again, our objective—our objectives of creating jobs and maintaining price stability, I think, are quite consistent with helping the average American, but there’s limits to what we can do about long-run trends, and I think those are very important issues that Congress and the Administration, you know, need to look at and decide, you know, what needs to be done there.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
316,"Hi, Jeremy Tordjman, with AFP.",JEREMY TORDJMAN.
317,Some emerging countries are blaming the Fed policies for the financial distress that they are experiencing.,JEREMY TORDJMAN.
318,I wanted to have your take on that.,JEREMY TORDJMAN.
319,"And also, how did you judge the way the markets reacted to your tapering announcement back in June?",JEREMY TORDJMAN.
320,Thank you very much.,JEREMY TORDJMAN.
321,"Well, let me just talk about—I talked a little bit about the communication in June.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
322,"Let me talk just about the emerging markets, which I think is an emerging markets.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
323,I spend a lot of time talking to my colleagues in emerging markets.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
324,So we’re watching that very carefully.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
325,"The United States is part of a globally integrated economic and financial system, and problems in emerging markets—or in any country, for that matter—can affect the United States as well.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
326,"And so, again, we are watching those developments very carefully.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
327,"It is true that changes in longer-term interest rates in the United States—but also in other advanced economies—does have some effect on emerging markets, particularly those who are trying to peg their exchange rate, and can lead to some capital inflows or outflows.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
328,But there are also other factors that affect inflows and outflows.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
329,"Those include changes in risk preference by investors, changes in growth expectations, different perceptions of institutional strength within emerging markets across different countries.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
330,"So there are a lot of factors that are there playing a role, and that’s one reason why different emerging markets have had different experiences.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
331,They have different institutional structures and different policies.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
332,"But, just to come to the bottom line here, we think it’s very important that emerging markets grow and are prosperous.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
333,We pay close attention to what’s happening in those countries—it affects the United States.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
334,"The main point, I guess, I would end with, though, is that what we’re trying to do with our monetary policy here is, I think, my colleagues in the emerging markets recognize, is trying to create a stronger U.S. economy.",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
335,And a stronger U.S. economy is one of the most important things that could happen to help the economies of emerging markets.,CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
336,"And, again, I think my colleagues in many of the emerging markets appreciate that—notwithstanding some of the effects that they may have felt—that efforts to strengthen the U.S. economy and other advanced",CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
