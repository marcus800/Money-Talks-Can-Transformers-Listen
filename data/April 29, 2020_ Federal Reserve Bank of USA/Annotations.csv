0,Good afternoon.,CHAIR POWELL.
1,Thanks for joining us today.,CHAIR POWELL.
2,I would like to begin by acknowledging the tragic loss and tremendous hardship that people are experiencing both here in the United States and around the world.,CHAIR POWELL.
3,"The coronavirus outbreak is first and foremost a public health crisis, and the most important response is coming from those in the front lines in hospitals, emergency services, and care facilities.",CHAIR POWELL.
4,"On behalf of the Federal Reserve, let me express our sincere gratitude to those dedicated individuals who put themselves at risk, day after day, in service to others and to our nation.",CHAIR POWELL.
5,The forceful measures that we as a country are taking to control the spread of the virus have brought much of the economy to an abrupt halt.,CHAIR POWELL.
6,"Many businesses have closed, people have been asked to stay home, and basic social interactions are greatly curtailed.",CHAIR POWELL.
7,"People are putting their lives and livelihoods on hold, at significant economic and personal cost.",CHAIR POWELL.
8,"All of us are affected, but the burdens are falling most heavily on those least able to carry them.",CHAIR POWELL.
9,It is worth remembering that the measures we are taking to contain the virus represent an investment in our individual and collective health.,CHAIR POWELL.
10,"As a society, we should do everything we can to provide relief to those who are suffering for the public good.",CHAIR POWELL.
11,"While many standard economic statistics have yet to catch up with the reality we’re experiencing, it’s clear that the effects on the economy are severe.",CHAIR POWELL.
12,"Millions of workers are losing their jobs:  Next week’s jobs report is expected to show that the unemployment rate, which was at 50-year lows just two months ago, has surged into double digits.",CHAIR POWELL.
13,"Household spending has plummeted as people stay home, and measures of consumer sentiment have fallen precipitously.",CHAIR POWELL.
14,"Hotels, airlines, restaurants, department stores, and other retailers have been particularly hard hit.",CHAIR POWELL.
15,Manufacturing output fell sharply in March and is likely to drop even more likely drop at an unprecedented rate in the second quarter.,CHAIR POWELL.
16,"Inflation is also being held down, reflecting weaker demand as well as significantly lower energy prices.",CHAIR POWELL.
17,Both the depth and the duration of the economic downturn are extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on how quickly the virus is brought under control.,CHAIR POWELL.
18,The severity of the downturn will also depend on the policy actions taken at all levels of government to cushion the blow and to support the recovery when the public health crisis passes.,CHAIR POWELL.
19,"The Federal Reserve’s response is guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system.",CHAIR POWELL.
20,We are also committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time.,CHAIR POWELL.
21,Last month we quickly lowered our policy interest rate to near zero.,CHAIR POWELL.
22,We stated then and again today that we expect to maintain interest rates at this level until we’re confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.,CHAIR POWELL.
23,"Of course, lowering interest rates cannot stop the sharp drop in economic activity caused by closures and other forms of social distancing.",CHAIR POWELL.
24,And low rates will not effectively spur the economy if those rates do not feed through to broader financial conditions or if households and businesses are unable to get credit.,CHAIR POWELL.
25,The economic disruptions caused by the virus created tremendous strains in some essential financial markets and have impaired the flow of credit in the economy.,CHAIR POWELL.
26,"Without access to credit, families can be forced to cut back on necessities and could lose their homes.",CHAIR POWELL.
27,"Businesses can be forced to downsize or close, resulting in further losses of jobs and incomes and worsening the downturn.",CHAIR POWELL.
28,Preserving the flow of credit is thus essential for mitigating the forceful actions to these ends.,CHAIR POWELL.
29,"To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, foster smooth market functioning, and promote effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions, we have been purchasing large amounts of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities.",CHAIR POWELL.
30,"The markets for these securities play a critical role in the economy, and they came under great stress last month as the scale of economic disruption became clearer and as investors clamored for liquidity.",CHAIR POWELL.
31,Our purchases have helped market conditions improve substantially in recent weeks.,CHAIR POWELL.
32,"In light of this improvement, we have slowed our pace of purchases.",CHAIR POWELL.
33,We will continue our purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities as needed.,CHAIR POWELL.
34,"While the primary purpose of these securities purchases is to preserve smooth market functioning and effective policy transmission, the purchases will offer—will also foster more accommodative financial conditions.",CHAIR POWELL.
35,"We are also undertaking programs to provide stability to the financial system and to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy—for households, for businesses of all sizes, and for state and local governments.",CHAIR POWELL.
36,These programs benefit the economy by providing financing where it is not otherwise available.,CHAIR POWELL.
37,"In addition, by serving as a backstop to key credit markets, the programs can improve market functioning by increasing the willingness of private lenders to extend credit.",CHAIR POWELL.
38,"Many of these programs rely on emergency lending powers that are available only in very unusual circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in today.",CHAIR POWELL.
39,"We are deploying these lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by the financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury.",CHAIR POWELL.
40,We will continue to use these powers recovery.,CHAIR POWELL.
41,I would stress that these are lending powers and not spending powers.,CHAIR POWELL.
42,The Fed cannot grant money to particular beneficiaries.,CHAIR POWELL.
43,We can only make loans to solvent entities that the—with the expectation that the loans will be repaid.,CHAIR POWELL.
44,"Many borrowers will benefit from our programs, as will the overall economy.",CHAIR POWELL.
45,"But for many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer.",CHAIR POWELL.
46,"In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed.",CHAIR POWELL.
47,"Elected officials have the power to tax and spend and to make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources.",CHAIR POWELL.
48,"The Cares Act and other legislation provide direct help to people, businesses, and communities.",CHAIR POWELL.
49,"This direct support can make a critical difference not just in helping families and businesses in a time of need, but also in limiting long-lasting damage to our economy.",CHAIR POWELL.
50,"At the Fed, we’re doing all we can to help American families and businesses weather this difficult period.",CHAIR POWELL.
51,"When the spread of the virus is under control, businesses will reopen, and people will come back to work.",CHAIR POWELL.
52,"We will continue to use our tools to assure that the recovery, when it comes, will be as robust as possible.",CHAIR POWELL.
53,"Thank you, and I’ll be glad to take your questions.",CHAIR POWELL.
54,Jeanna Smialek.,MICHELLE SMITH.
55,"Hi, Chair Powell.",JEANNA SMIALEK.
56,Thanks for taking our questions.,JEANNA SMIALEK.
57,"You guys have cut rates to zero, you’re buying up huge quantities of government debt—I guess the question is, what more can you realistically do to help the economy, and where do you see a need for Congress to step in?",JEANNA SMIALEK.
58,So let me say that we’re—we’re committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time.,CHAIR POWELL.
59,"We’re going to use them, as I mentioned, recovery and also to assure that that recovery, when it comes, will be as robust as possible.",CHAIR POWELL.
60,"As long as needed, we’ll use them.",CHAIR POWELL.
61,"And I would just say, we have a number of dimensions on which we can still provide support to the economy.",CHAIR POWELL.
62,"As you know, our credit policies are not subject to a specific dollar limit.",CHAIR POWELL.
63,"They can be expanded as appropriate, and we can do new ones.",CHAIR POWELL.
64,So we can continue to be part of the answer.,CHAIR POWELL.
65,"Will there be a need to do more, though?",CHAIR POWELL.
66,"I think the answer to that—that will be “yes.”  I would say, Congress has also reacted quite aggressively and strongly with the Cares Act and other laws—several other laws.",CHAIR POWELL.
67,And that’s appropriate.,CHAIR POWELL.
68,"With enhanced unemployment insurance and the Paycheck Protection Program, we’ve seen an extraordinary, historically large reaction.",CHAIR POWELL.
69,But I would say that it may well be the case that the economy will need more support from all of us if the—if the recovery is to be a robust one.,CHAIR POWELL.
70,Nick Timiraos.,MICHELLE SMITH.
71,"Thanks, Chair Powell.",NICK TIMIRAOS.
72,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.,NICK TIMIRAOS.
73,"I want to follow up on Jeanna’s question and ask, what specifically do you think elected officials should consider in order to help return or hasten a stronger return to full employment?",NICK TIMIRAOS.
74,And what policy tools did you discuss at your meeting today that might be used to stop a deflationary spiral?,NICK TIMIRAOS.
75,So let me—let me start—I’ll take the questions in the order you—you gave them.,CHAIR POWELL.
76,"So in terms of, if I can say, legislative priorities, we don’t—we’re not responsible for fiscal policy.",CHAIR POWELL.
77,Those will be decisions for Congress to make.,CHAIR POWELL.
78,"But I would say that policies that protect workers, businesses, and households from avoidable insolvency, that keep businesses going so that they’re able to produce goods and—and to either hold on to their price tag, but we would come out of this event eventually with—with a stronger economy and with less long-run damage to the economy.",CHAIR POWELL.
79,"So that’s—that’s a key thing that—that, really, Congress could do over time.",CHAIR POWELL.
80,"In terms of what we can do, I mentioned, we have our—our credit facilities are—are wide open.",CHAIR POWELL.
81,We can do more on that front.,CHAIR POWELL.
82,"In addition, you know, we’ve had—we’ve had extensive discussions, as I’ve mentioned—done a lot of thinking about what monetary policy might look like over—in coming months over a range of potential scenarios for the economy.",CHAIR POWELL.
83,We do think that our—our policy stance today is right where it should be for now.,CHAIR POWELL.
84,"As you know, we cut rates to the effective lower bound, we—and we’ve said that we’ll keep them there until we’re confident that the economy has weathered the effects of the outbreak and is on track to achieve our goals.",CHAIR POWELL.
85,"With asset purchases, we’re continuing to purchase Treasury securities and agency MBS in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning.",CHAIR POWELL.
86,"So we’re doing those things, and I would say that we’ll continue to use our tools as needs be.",CHAIR POWELL.
87,Steve Liesman.,MICHELLE SMITH.
88,"Mr. Chairman, question—Steve Liesman with CNBC.",STEVE LIESMAN.
89,I’ve got two questions here.,STEVE LIESMAN.
90,"First of all, why aren’t you announcing or conducting a specific quantitative easing program?",STEVE LIESMAN.
91,And—and maybe you could explain what the context is now of the purchases that will be made and the amounts that are to come.,STEVE LIESMAN.
92,"The second question I have is, are—is the Federal Reserve really taking enough risk to help households and businesses here, in that you just said that the programs that are out there may be best for those who are able to repay loans.",STEVE LIESMAN.
93,But—so don’t you have a series of programs it the least?,STEVE LIESMAN.
94,Thank you.,STEVE LIESMAN.
95,"So, let me say again, in terms of—of asset purchases and—and other measures, we—we do think our—our policy stance is appropriate now.",CHAIR POWELL.
96,"We’ve had discussions, as I’ve mentioned, over time and done quite a bit of thinking about what we might do in the future.",CHAIR POWELL.
97,"We think, for now, our policy stance is appropriate.",CHAIR POWELL.
98,We’re not going to change it now.,CHAIR POWELL.
99,And we’re really waiting to see more from the economy.,CHAIR POWELL.
100,"There are a range of potential paths the economy could be on, and I think as—as the time approaches for—then we’ll—you know, we’ll address your first question, which is about asset purchases.",CHAIR POWELL.
101,So—but that’s not something we’re doing today.,CHAIR POWELL.
102,"It’s—it’s something that we have talked about, and, you know, for now, we like our current policy stance.",CHAIR POWELL.
103,"In terms of risk, so, you know, we operate under the laws that Congress passes.",CHAIR POWELL.
104,"And there are a number of aspects under section 13(3), and you can see that they’ve permitted us to, I think, move very quickly and move into areas where we’ve never been before and do so quite aggressively.",CHAIR POWELL.
105,"So I—I think we’re going places and providing help in places where we never have, and I’m glad that we are.",CHAIR POWELL.
106,I think it’s appropriate that we are.,CHAIR POWELL.
107,"Nonetheless, these are lending powers.",CHAIR POWELL.
108,"And if you read section 13(3) of the Dodd-Frank—or, the Federal Reserve Act, and I know you have, it does require that—that we be secured to our satisfaction, and—and we can’t lend to insolvent companies.",CHAIR POWELL.
109,"You know, it’s clear these are lending powers, and we are—we are ultimately bound to—to implement the laws that Congress gives us.",CHAIR POWELL.
110,We—we do not make grants.,CHAIR POWELL.
111,We can’t make grants.,CHAIR POWELL.
112,And I—the reason I raised that in my remarks is that I just want to be clear on that.,CHAIR POWELL.
113,those powers.,CHAIR POWELL.
114,We will—we’ll keep at it.,CHAIR POWELL.
115,And you—I just want people to know that we’ll—we will be at it with—with the legal authorities that we have until we get through this thing.,CHAIR POWELL.
116,We will keep using our authorities.,CHAIR POWELL.
117,"But there are authorities that we don’t have, and there may be a need for those authorities to be used as well as ours.",CHAIR POWELL.
118,Heather Long.,MICHELLE SMITH.
119,Hi.,HEATHER LONG.
120,"Hi, Chair Powell, it’s Heather Long from the Washington Post.",HEATHER LONG.
121,"I have two questions for you, both on timing.",HEATHER LONG.
122,"The first, do you plan to launch the Corporate Credit Facility and the Main Street lending facilities in May or early May?",HEATHER LONG.
123,Anything you can give us—a sense on timing?,HEATHER LONG.
124,"And the second, in the statement, you referred today—the FOMC refers today to a lot of medium-term risks from the pandemic.",HEATHER LONG.
125,That sounds like you all think this is going to be a long recovery—a long road to recovery.,HEATHER LONG.
126,Can you give any more guidance on how you all see this recovery taking shape?,HEATHER LONG.
127,Thanks.,HEATHER LONG.
128,Sure.,CHAIR POWELL.
129,"So, in terms of those facilities, the corporate credit facilities are near being finalized and will be operating, I would say, soon—fairly soon.",CHAIR POWELL.
130,Main Street facility is—we’re close to announcing—to issuing a new term sheet.,CHAIR POWELL.
131,"As you know, we put out a term sheet for comment a while back, and we got a couple thousand comments.",CHAIR POWELL.
132,We’ve carefully studied them.,CHAIR POWELL.
133,We’ve tried to reflect those in what we’re doing now.,CHAIR POWELL.
134,"I think, with Main Street, there’ll be at least a couple of different kinds of lending going on there.",CHAIR POWELL.
135,"It—this is a broad area of the economy with many different kinds of credit needs, so we’re going to keep at that for some time, I think, adding in sectors and lending products.",CHAIR POWELL.
136,So I think we’ll be at—we’ll as quickly.,CHAIR POWELL.
137,"But the first part of it, I think, will be done fairly quickly.",CHAIR POWELL.
138,"In terms of our statement, so what we said was that we—I’ll just read the sentence.",CHAIR POWELL.
139,"It says:  “[The] ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.”  So the “medium”—but what we meant by that, “over the medium term”—so, obviously, what we’re talking about is, you know, not right now, in the very near term.",CHAIR POWELL.
140,"It’s between now and the long term, so the next year or so.",CHAIR POWELL.
141,And I would point to a couple of—of risks to the outlook that—what we were thinking of.,CHAIR POWELL.
142,First is just the virus.,CHAIR POWELL.
143,How long will it take to get it under control?,CHAIR POWELL.
144,Will there be additional outbreaks?,CHAIR POWELL.
145,Will there be drugs that can either treat it or—or a vaccine of some kind?,CHAIR POWELL.
146,So there’s—all of that is very much shrouded in uncertainty.,CHAIR POWELL.
147,The second issue—and this is a very substantial one—is just the possibility of—of damage to the productive capacity of the economy through a couple of channels.,CHAIR POWELL.
148,"The first is just workers who—if one is unemployed for an extended period, that person can—can lose the skills that are needed, can lose touch with the labor force, and have difficulty restarting his or her career.",CHAIR POWELL.
149,"So that’s a—that’s a feature of deep and long recessions, and that’s something we’ve got to watch out for.",CHAIR POWELL.
150,"Another is just businesses—you know, these thousands of great medium- and small-sized businesses that we have all over the country.",CHAIR POWELL.
151,They’re worth so much more to the economy than the sum of their net assets.,CHAIR POWELL.
152,"They contain—you know, they’re job creators, they’re really important.",CHAIR POWELL.
153,"And if we see an unnecessary—unnecessary insolvencies, a wave of those, that could be damaging to the performance of the economy over time.",CHAIR POWELL.
154,So the good news is that we not perfectly.,CHAIR POWELL.
155,So that’s—that’s another risk.,CHAIR POWELL.
156,The third thing I would point to is just the global dimension.,CHAIR POWELL.
157,"This is a very global phenomenon, and you are—we’re seeing economic data from around the globe which is very, very negative, and that, too, can weigh on U.S. economic performance over time.",CHAIR POWELL.
158,"I—you know, I would say, just on the U.S.—on the U.S. economy, there are things you can say, one can say.",CHAIR POWELL.
159,"The first is that, in the near term, we’re going to see, you know, significant declines in economic activity, significant declines in employment, and increases in unemployment.",CHAIR POWELL.
160,We’re going to see that as a consequence of the virus and the measures we’re taking to protect ourselves from it.,CHAIR POWELL.
161,"The next phases are more uncertain, highly uncertain, but we will go through a phase starting fairly soon where we begin to reopen the economy.",CHAIR POWELL.
162,And probably the economic activity will pick up as consumer spending picks up.,CHAIR POWELL.
163,"Consumer spending, as I mentioned, has gone down quite a lot.",CHAIR POWELL.
164,It’ll begin to pick up as people start to return to their normal patterns of spending.,CHAIR POWELL.
165,"But the chances are that it won’t go right back to where we were, because people will—until they’re confident of—that the virus is well and truly under control, then they will be somewhat probably reluctant to—to undertake certain kinds of activity.",CHAIR POWELL.
166,"So it may take some time for us to get back—it probably will take some time for us to get back to—you know, to a more normal level of unemployment and—and, ultimately, to maximum employment.",CHAIR POWELL.
167,"Okay, James Politi.",MICHELLE SMITH.
168,"Thanks, Chair Powell.",JAMES POLITI.
169,You didn’t firm up your guidance on—this is James Politi from the Financial Times—you didn’t firm up your guidance on interest rates at this meeting.,JAMES POLITI.
170,"And given the risks that you just outlined, under what circumstances would you strengthen the Fed’s commitment to keep rates at the lower bound?",JAMES POLITI.
171,"And is there any danger to expecting for the programs that were set up under the Cares Act, and are you expecting them to rapidly reach capacity like the PPP plan did?",JAMES POLITI.
172,Okay.,CHAIR POWELL.
173,"So on the first, as I mentioned, you know, we moved very quickly, very aggressively.",CHAIR POWELL.
174,"We were the first to return to the effective lower bound, where we are now.",CHAIR POWELL.
175,"We got there essentially right away, and we think that’s the right place to be.",CHAIR POWELL.
176,"We think, if you look at surveys, you look at market pricing, the market expects us to—to be there for a good while, and that’s appropriate.",CHAIR POWELL.
177,"So, you know, it’s not as though the market is pricing in a near-term liftoff or anything like that.",CHAIR POWELL.
178,"And let me just say, we’re going to not be in any hurry to withdraw these measures or to lift off.",CHAIR POWELL.
179,We’re going to wait until we’re—we’re quite confident that the economy is—is well on the road to recovery.,CHAIR POWELL.
180,So we don’t see—we see our current stance and our current guidance—and I would say the same thing about asset purchases—we see them as appropriate.,CHAIR POWELL.
181,"I’ve—I’ve also mentioned now a couple times that we have done a lot of thinking about what monetary policy might look like over coming months, and that would, you know, depend on—on where we are in—in a range of potential economic scenarios.",CHAIR POWELL.
182,"So we—we were thinking about that all the time, but right now, for now, we think our current stance is appropriate.",CHAIR POWELL.
183,So we made no change in it today.,CHAIR POWELL.
184,"Second question was, how—so the thing about our facilities is, Treasury still has plenty of equity.",CHAIR POWELL.
185,"So we’ve said that if—if demand for our facilities is greater than we’ve estimated, then we’ll expand them.",CHAIR POWELL.
186,And we have the ability to do that.,CHAIR POWELL.
187,"So it won’t be the way the—the Paycheck Protection Program is, where there’s a specific amount allocated—appropriated for it, and—and then there’s no more money.",CHAIR POWELL.
188,"That’s—that will be unlikely to happen here unless we exhaust Treasury’s equity, and we’re a long way from doing that.",CHAIR POWELL.
189,"facilities—and I mentioned this in my remarks—it’s not just the actual lending we do, it’s the—we build confidence in the market.",CHAIR POWELL.
190,And private market participants come in.,CHAIR POWELL.
191,And many companies that would’ve had to come to the Fed have now been able to finance themselves privately since we announced the—the initial term sheet on—on these facilities.,CHAIR POWELL.
192,So that’s a good thing.,CHAIR POWELL.
193,"Companies are out there financing, they’re out there raising liquidity.",CHAIR POWELL.
194,We haven’t made any corporate loans to—in those facilities.,CHAIR POWELL.
195,"We’ve made the short-term money market loans, but—we haven’t made any of them.",CHAIR POWELL.
196,"And yet there’s a tremendous amount of financing going on, and that’s a good thing.",CHAIR POWELL.
197,"So we—for that reason, the ultimate demand for the facilities is quite difficult to predict, because there is this announcement effect that really gets the market functioning again.",CHAIR POWELL.
198,"Of course, we have to follow through, though.",CHAIR POWELL.
199,And we will follow through to validate that—that announcement effect.,CHAIR POWELL.
200,"Okay, Howard Schneider.",MICHELLE SMITH.
201,"Oh, hi, Chair Powell, and thanks for doing this.",HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
202,I wanted to get your—a little more expansion on the timing of recovery and the—the connection between the health response.,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
203,"You said earlier, I think, that you thought the second half of the year could see a pretty robust rebound.",HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
204,Is that now out of the question?,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
205,"And do you think a steady recovery is really possible until a vaccine’s developed, given the patchwork of measures we’ve seen taken around the states?",HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
206,"Is that going to really lead us to a steady path out, absent a vaccine?",HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
207,"You know, as you know, economic forecasts are always uncertain.",CHAIR POWELL.
208,"Today they’re unusually uncertain, and that’s—that’s really because so much of the performance of the economy depends on the path of the virus and the success of the measures we take to And our tools, the things that we do, don’t affect any of those things.",CHAIR POWELL.
209,"We’re not experts on those things either, but what the experts tell us is that the outcomes are highly uncertain.",CHAIR POWELL.
210,"So this is an unusual, new kind of uncertainty added on top of our—our regular uncertainty.",CHAIR POWELL.
211,"But I—I will say, there—I think there are a few things that you can say about—about the path ahead.",CHAIR POWELL.
212,"First, this time, now, is going to be a time of sharp contraction in economic activity, high unemployment.",CHAIR POWELL.
213,"Personal consumption expenditures have declined sharply, business investment as well.",CHAIR POWELL.
214,Unemployment moved up.,CHAIR POWELL.
215,We’re going to see economic data for the second quarter that’s worse than any data we’ve seen for the economy.,CHAIR POWELL.
216,And they’re a direct consequence of the disease and the measures that we’re taking to protect ourselves from it.,CHAIR POWELL.
217,"So then we will enter this new phase, and we—we’re just beginning to maybe do that, where we will—formal measures that require social distancing will be rolled back gradually and at different paces in different parts of the country.",CHAIR POWELL.
218,"And, in time, this—during this period, the economy will begin to recover.",CHAIR POWELL.
219,"People will come out of their homes, start to spend again.",CHAIR POWELL.
220,"We’ll see unemployment go down, we’ll see economic activity pick up.",CHAIR POWELL.
221,"And, you know, when will that be?",CHAIR POWELL.
222,It’s very hard to say.,CHAIR POWELL.
223,"But let’s just say, for this purpose, that it’s in the third quarter.",CHAIR POWELL.
224,"So, as I mentioned earlier, that—that could be a fairly, you know, a large increase.",CHAIR POWELL.
225,"Given the—given the size of the fall, the increase could also be substantially large, although it’s unlikely that it would bring us quickly, quickly all the way back to pre-crisis levels.",CHAIR POWELL.
226,"Of course, this is the period as well that carries the risk of new outbreaks of the virus, something we really want to avoid.",CHAIR POWELL.
227,"I think then, after that period, at some point you will have—you know, the kind of formal social-distancing measures will—will be gone, but you’ll still be left with, probably, a level of for some time.",CHAIR POWELL.
228,You would think that behavior will change as people gain confidence.,CHAIR POWELL.
229,"So the—the sooner we get the virus under control, the sooner people can regain that confidence and regain their economic activity.",CHAIR POWELL.
230,I think trying to be really precise about when that might happen and what the numbers might look like is—I think it’s very tough to do that.,CHAIR POWELL.
231,"Okay, Steve Matthews.",MICHELLE SMITH.
232,Steve Matthews with Bloomberg.,STEVE MATTHEWS.
233,"Chairman Powell, you’ve noted a number of times over the last year that there’s been a broadening out of job gains with marginalized workers, people who have been left out of the recovery over the 10-year period, finally making job gains, and—particularly minorities, but also many other workers.",STEVE MATTHEWS.
234,"Do you worry that this recession is going to fall hardest on those workers who’ve struggled and just got job gains in the last year or two, and that it may take years from now before there are opportunities for them again?",STEVE MATTHEWS.
235,Yes.,CHAIR POWELL.
236,That’s exactly what I worry about.,CHAIR POWELL.
237,So unemployment has tended to go up much faster for minorities and for others who are—tend to be at the low end of the income spectrum.,CHAIR POWELL.
238,"And it tends to come down—come down faster as well, but it tends to go up faster and be much, much higher.",CHAIR POWELL.
239,"And we were in a place—only two months ago, we were well into—beginning the second half of the 11th year is where we were, and every reason to think that it was ongoing.",CHAIR POWELL.
240,We were hearing from minority—low- and moderate-income and minority communities that this was the best labor market they’d seen in their lifetime.,CHAIR POWELL.
241,All the data supported that as well.,CHAIR POWELL.
242,"And it is heartbreaking, frankly, to see that all threatened now.",CHAIR POWELL.
243,"All the more need for our urgent response—and also that of Congress, which has been urgent and large—and to do what we can to avoid longer-run damage to the economy, which is what I—I because there was something wrong with the economy.",CHAIR POWELL.
244,"And I think it is important that we do everything we can to avoid that longer-run damage and try to get back to where we were, because I do very much have that concern.",CHAIR POWELL.
245,"I think everyone is suffering here, but I think those who are least able to—to bear it are the ones who are, you know, losing their jobs and losing their incomes and have little cushion to—you know, to protect them in times like that.",CHAIR POWELL.
246,"So, yes, that’s a very big concern.",CHAIR POWELL.
247,Victoria.,MICHELLE SMITH.
248,"Hi, I’m Victoria Guida with Politico.",VICTORIA GUIDA.
249,The Paycheck Protection Program has experienced some logistical problems because of the speed at which all of this is happening.,VICTORIA GUIDA.
250,"For the Main Street lending facilities, which will also work through banks, what lessons are you taking away from that?",VICTORIA GUIDA.
251,"And then, more broadly, you know, you mentioned earlier this year that the federal debt was on an unsustainable path.",VICTORIA GUIDA.
252,"And I was just wondering, for Republicans that are starting to get worried about how much fiscal spending they’re having to do in this crisis, you know, whether that should be a concern for them.",VICTORIA GUIDA.
253,So a couple things.,CHAIR POWELL.
254,"This is different from the PPP, the Paycheck Protection Program, in two ways.",CHAIR POWELL.
255,"One is, these are not grants, these are loans.",CHAIR POWELL.
256,So I don’t know that the demand will be quite as strong as—as it has been for the PPP.,CHAIR POWELL.
257,I don’t know that.,CHAIR POWELL.
258,"And the second thing is, we won’t run out of money.",CHAIR POWELL.
259,"You know, it’s not a limited pot, so there won’t be this incentive to try to get there first and that sort of thing.",CHAIR POWELL.
260,"So I’m—I’m hopeful we—we will very much try to learn as much as possible from that facility and from all the other ones, too.",CHAIR POWELL.
261,"We have a lot to learn here, so we’ll certainly be trying to do that.",CHAIR POWELL.
262,"Fed, I have longtime been an advocate for the need for the United States to return to a sustainable path from a fiscal perspective at the federal level.",CHAIR POWELL.
263,"We have not been on such a path for some time, which means—just means that the debt is growing faster than the economy.",CHAIR POWELL.
264,This is not the time to act on those concerns.,CHAIR POWELL.
265,This is the time to use the great fiscal power of the United States to—to do what we can to support the economy and try to get through this with as little damage to the longer-run productive capacity of the economy as possible.,CHAIR POWELL.
266,"The time will come again—and reasonably soon, I think—where we can—where we can think about a long-term way to get our fiscal house in order.",CHAIR POWELL.
267,And we absolutely need to do that.,CHAIR POWELL.
268,"But this is not the time to be—in my personal view, this is not the time to—to let that concern, which is a very serious concern, but—to let that get in the way of us winning this battle, really.",CHAIR POWELL.
269,"Okay, Edward Lawrence.",MICHELLE SMITH.
270,"Oh, yes.",EDWARD LAWRENCE.
271,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",EDWARD LAWRENCE.
272,Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network.,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
273,"Now, given the amount of stimulus on the fiscal side and monetary policy side, how much weight do you give to finding a vaccine, from clearing that uncertainty you talked about around treatment and whatnot, for the Federal Reserve pulling back on some of the Fed’s actions and raising the rates from the zero lower bound?",EDWARD LAWRENCE.
274,"Also, when does that Main Street lending facility get deployed?",EDWARD LAWRENCE.
275,"Because you talked about “soon”—you know, some businesses are in need now.",EDWARD LAWRENCE.
276,Thank you.,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
277,"You know, so we don’t—we’re not in a position to make, you know, a reliable assessment of when a vaccine or a therapeutic drug would be ready, and so we’re not going to set our policies based on—on our estimate of that.",CHAIR POWELL.
278,We’re going to just provide the the recovery’s well under way.,CHAIR POWELL.
279,"In terms of Main Street, so you know the story.",CHAIR POWELL.
280,"We put out a term sheet, we got a lot of comments, we took those very much to heart.",CHAIR POWELL.
281,We’ve spent a great deal of time here.,CHAIR POWELL.
282,"It’s a challenging space, because it’s many different kinds of borrowers—they have different needs, different sizes of companies.",CHAIR POWELL.
283,"And so, we’re—as I mentioned, we’re very close to announcing a new term sheet, which will then become operative fairly quickly.",CHAIR POWELL.
284,"My guess is, though, that we’ll keep—we’ll keep looking to add products and add different kinds of borrowers to that as we go.",CHAIR POWELL.
285,And we’re—we’re well aware of the importance of—of doing it as quickly as possible.,CHAIR POWELL.
286,"We, here, you know, we’re very much in touch with—with the urgency of that need.",CHAIR POWELL.
287,"Okay, Don Lee.",MICHELLE SMITH.
288,"Chair Powell, it’s Don Lee from the L.A. Times.",DON LEE.
289,I just wanted to follow up on a question—the question on the labor market.,DON LEE.
290,"I know you said that it’s highly uncertain but, you know, there are analysts who think that we’ll have very high unemployment until even the end of next year, as high as 9 percent.",DON LEE.
291,"And, at this point, what—can you just talk a little bit more about what you see as the path of employment in the coming months and into next year?",DON LEE.
292,Sure.,CHAIR POWELL.
293,So unemployment’s going to go up to a high number in the second quarter—uncertain what the number will be.,CHAIR POWELL.
294,"When—and that’s because so much economic activity has been shuttered, really, as we take social-distancing measures.",CHAIR POWELL.
295,"And the—so sometime fairly soon here, and probably gradually and at different paces at different parts of the country, we’ll see the social-distancing measures rolled back.",CHAIR POWELL.
296,People will begin to spend more money.,CHAIR POWELL.
297,"It’s, really, consumer spending has fallen precipitously.",CHAIR POWELL.
298,"And once that starts to happen, people will get hired back and unemployment will go back down.",CHAIR POWELL.
299,"I don’t think it’ll get think it will take some time for that to happen, for us to get back to anything that resembles maximum employment.",CHAIR POWELL.
300,"But, I mean, the main thing we want is, we want to get back on that road.",CHAIR POWELL.
301,We want to get that—that recovery going and get people back to work as fast as we can.,CHAIR POWELL.
302,"Not faster than we can, but as fast as we can.",CHAIR POWELL.
303,"The main thing is to get into that stage where the economy’s healing, where we have the disease under control, where we don’t, you know, take too much risk of—of second and third waves and that sort of thing, and get people back to work.",CHAIR POWELL.
304,"And, you know, it’s—again, the path of it is highly uncertain, but we will—we will be there with our tools, supporting the economy and supporting that recovery.",CHAIR POWELL.
305,Scott Horsley.,MICHELLE SMITH.
306,"Thanks, Mr. Chairman.",SCOTT HORSLEY.
307,"After the financial crisis, banks were instructed to up their capital so they could weather an economic shock.",SCOTT HORSLEY.
308,What kind of steps do you think we need to take for the economy writ large to make it more resilient to this kind of shock?,SCOTT HORSLEY.
309,Can you just say that part—you’re a little bit low volume.,CHAIR POWELL.
310,Yes.,SCOTT HORSLEY.
311,What kind of steps could we take to help the economy as a whole be more resilient to this kind of exogenous shock?,SCOTT HORSLEY.
312,"You know, it’s an extraordinary, extraordinary shock, unlike anything, certainly, that’s happened in my lifetime.",CHAIR POWELL.
313,And a couple things come to mind.,CHAIR POWELL.
314,I—I think the time will come for a careful assessment of the answers to those questions.,CHAIR POWELL.
315,It’s early to be asking them.,CHAIR POWELL.
316,We’re still putting out the fire.,CHAIR POWELL.
317,We’re still trying to win.,CHAIR POWELL.
318,And I think we’ll be at that for a while.,CHAIR POWELL.
319,"strengthen the banks:  much higher levels of capital, liquidity, far greater sense of what the risks are they’re running and how to manage them.",CHAIR POWELL.
320,So the breakdowns that we’ve seen in market function have really been in the capital markets.,CHAIR POWELL.
321,And I don’t—I wouldn’t rush in with prudential regulation into the capital markets.,CHAIR POWELL.
322,"But I think—and we did plenty of things—you know, triparty—you know, we did a lot of reform in the capital markets:  money market reform, triparty repo reform, central clearing, all these important things.",CHAIR POWELL.
323,"But there—there will no doubt be—with this—the size and force of this shock will no doubt reveal weaknesses in the financial architecture, and we’ll have to go to work on those.",CHAIR POWELL.
324,"I—I also think it—you know, it tells you the importance of—of getting your fiscal house in order.",CHAIR POWELL.
325,The U.S. really hadn’t—really hadn’t gotten back to where we needed to get on fiscal policy.,CHAIR POWELL.
326,"And, you know, so we—we had an already high level of debt to GDP, and rising quickly, when this shock arrived.",CHAIR POWELL.
327,"Now, we have the fiscal capacity to deal with it, I believe.",CHAIR POWELL.
328,"But we will need to—ideally, you would go into an unexpected shock like this with a—with a much stronger fiscal—fiscal posture.",CHAIR POWELL.
329,Mike McKee.,MICHELLE SMITH.
330,"Mr. Chairman, given the demand drop, demand shock, and the drop in oil prices, do you anticipate that we might see any kind of deflation, even for a very short period, that would require a Fed response?",MICHAEL MCKEE.
331,"If we get a negative print on CPI or PCE, how should people think about that?",MICHAEL MCKEE.
332,"And second question—there is a disconnect, it appears, between the markets and the economic outlook right now.",MICHAEL MCKEE.
333,"And I know you said that this isn’t the time to worry about moral economy, there could be financial stability problems as this goes along?",MICHAEL MCKEE.
334,"In terms of inflation, we think that inflation is very closely and strongly related to inflation expectations.",CHAIR POWELL.
335,"And during the Global Financial Crisis, there was a concern that we might see deflation, but it didn’t happen.",CHAIR POWELL.
336,"Inflation expect—inflation tended to move down a little bit, as it will when demand is weak.",CHAIR POWELL.
337,And—but inflation expectations did not move strongly down here in the United States.,CHAIR POWELL.
338,"They have in other places in the world, though, over the past 25 years.",CHAIR POWELL.
339,"There’s been downward pressure on inflation, really, for several decades now.",CHAIR POWELL.
340,"So, I would say, as long as inflation expectations remain anchored, then we shouldn’t see deflation.",CHAIR POWELL.
341,And the Federal Reserve is strongly committed to maintaining 2 percent inflation over time.,CHAIR POWELL.
342,So we’ll be there to work on that.,CHAIR POWELL.
343,"I think you asked, really, about headline inflation.",CHAIR POWELL.
344,"If—if low energy prices—very low energy prices were to—were to drop headline inflation negative, I—I would hope that people would see through that—and we’ll be monitoring it very carefully—would see through it, though, and look to core, which is a better predictor of future inflation.",CHAIR POWELL.
345,"So, needless to say, we’ll be keeping very close track of that.",CHAIR POWELL.
346,"In terms of the markets, you know, our—our concern is that they be working.",CHAIR POWELL.
347,"We’re not—we’re not focused on the level of asset prices in particular, it’s just—markets are trying to price in something that is so uncertain as to be unknowable, which is the path of this virus globally and its effect on the economy.",CHAIR POWELL.
348,"And that’s very, very hard to do.",CHAIR POWELL.
349,"That’s why you see volatility the way it’s been, market reacting to—to things with a lot of volatility.",CHAIR POWELL.
350,"But, you know, what we’re trying to assure, really, is that the market is working.",CHAIR POWELL.
351,"The market is assessing risks, lenders are lending, borrowers are borrowing, asset prices are moving in response to events.",CHAIR POWELL.
352,"vulnerable among us, because if—if markets stop working and credit stops flowing, then you see—that’s when you see, you know, very sharp negative—even more negative economic outcomes.",CHAIR POWELL.
353,So I think our measures have—have supported market function pretty well.,CHAIR POWELL.
354,"You know, we’re going to stay very careful, carefully monitoring that.",CHAIR POWELL.
355,But I think it’s been good to see markets working again.,CHAIR POWELL.
356,"Particularly, the flow of credit in the economy has been a positive thing, as businesses have been able to build up their liquidity buffers and households have been able to be home—you know, people have been home, you know, concerned about their jobs, but they’re not concerned about the financial system collapsing as they were in 2008 and ’09.",CHAIR POWELL.
357,"Okay, Chris from the AP.",MICHELLE SMITH.
358,"Hi, Chair Powell.",CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
359,"Chris Rugaber over at AP, thank you.",CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
360,I guess I had two questions.,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
361,I wanted to start on the unemployment picture and nail down a little bit how you see—how you see things going from here.,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
362,You did talk about potential loss of skills over time.,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
363,"So are you worried about structural changes in job markets that would keep unemployment high and, therefore, potentially beyond the ability of the Fed to do anything about, which is something that was debated, as you know, after the last recession, and then eventually, of course, the unemployment rate did go lower than people thought?",CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
364,"Second question is just on the money from Treasury, the $454 billion.",CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
365,"It sounds like you want to keep that in reserve for programs that have high demand, such as the Main Street program.",CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
366,"Are you willing to use that to backstop, say, a program that is having more losses?",CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
367,"I mean, you know, what’s your tolerance for loss among that $454 billion?",CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
368,Thank you.,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
369,people’s skills and their careers and their lives is a function of time to some extent.,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
370,"So the longer one is unemployed, the harder it gets, I think—and we’ve probably all seen this in our lives—the harder it is to get back into the workforce and get back to where you were, if you ever do get back to where you were.",CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
371,"So, you know, longer and deeper downturns have had—have left more of a mark, generally, in that dimension with the labor force.",CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
372,"And so that’s why—as I mentioned, that’s why the urgency in doing what we can to prevent that longer-run damage.",CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
373,It doesn’t have to be that way.,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
374,"We won’t be able to limit all of it, but we do have the tools to—to do what we can to—to keep people in touch with the labor force and working and also out of insolvency, too.",CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
375,"It doesn’t seem fair that people should lose everything they have, including their homes, over this.",CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
376,"So, nonetheless, there will be some of that.",CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
377,But we do have some tools to ameliorate that.,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
378,"In terms of the—so in terms of the—the money, you know, the $454 billion, it’s a couple things.",CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
379,"First, the Treasury Secretary really has—has authority over that, right?",CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
380,And it stands in front of our losses.,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
381,"So, you know—but I do think we are—we’re clearly moving into areas where there is more risk than there has been in the past.",CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
382,And that’s okay.,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
383,I think that’s what we’re supposed to do.,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
384,This is—this is a very unusual time.,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
385,"And so—but in terms of the—of the way to think about that money, I think that’s really a question for the Treasury Department.",CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
386,"You know, we are—we set up the facilities, and we work very, very closely and successfully and collaboratively with the Treasury on this, but that—that particular aspect of it falls more to the Secretary.",CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
387,"Okay, we’ll go to Nancy Marshall-Genzer for the last question.",MICHELLE SMITH.
388,Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
389,"Chair Powell, I’m wondering what you would say to savers who are hurt by very low interest rates and I’m wondering if you can give us any more of a clue as to how long you think we’re going to have interest rates near zero.",NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
390,So we think that low interest rates affect the economy through a number of channels in a positive way.,CHAIR POWELL.
391,"Lower interest rates support economic activity through channels that we—overall, through channels that we understand reasonably well.",CHAIR POWELL.
392,"They make it cheaper to borrow, they make—they drive, you know, your costs of borrowing down.",CHAIR POWELL.
393,"They do—they do raise asset prices, including the value of your home.",CHAIR POWELL.
394,"If your saver owns a home or has a 401(k), your saver will benefit from that.",CHAIR POWELL.
395,"But for people who are really, really just relying on their bank savings account earnings, this is—you know, that’s—that’s—you’re not going to benefit from low interest rates.",CHAIR POWELL.
396,"But we—you know, we have to look out for the overall economy.",CHAIR POWELL.
397,"Low interest rates support employment, they support economic activity, and those are our mandates.",CHAIR POWELL.
398,"And I think for the overall good of the economy, low interest rates are a good thing.",CHAIR POWELL.
399,"And that’s not to say they’re good for every single person, but that shouldn’t stop us from doing what we think is—is good for the whole.",CHAIR POWELL.
400,"In terms of how low, I really don’t want to speculate.",CHAIR POWELL.
401,"You know, we will turn to questions like that soon enough.",CHAIR POWELL.
402,"But the—in terms of how long we’ll stay and under what conditions we’ll stay at the effective lower bound, those are just exactly the things we’re thinking about.",CHAIR POWELL.
403,Right now we like the place we are.,CHAIR POWELL.
404,We’ve said that we’ll keep our rates where they are until we’re confident that the economy has weathered the effects of the outbreak and is on track to achieve our—our goals.,CHAIR POWELL.
405,So that’s where we are.,CHAIR POWELL.
406,We’re leaving—we’re not changing that we’re—we’re not going to be in any hurry to move rates up.,CHAIR POWELL.
407,Thank you very much.,MICHELLE SMITH.
408,Thanks.,CHAIR POWELL.
