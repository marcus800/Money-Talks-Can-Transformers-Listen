0,Good afternoon.,CHAIR POWELL.
1,I would like to start by noting that it has been a full year since the pandemic arrived with force on our shores.,CHAIR POWELL.
2,"Looking back, it was clear that addressing a fast-moving global pandemic would be plainly and primarily the realm of health-care providers and experts, and we are grateful to them and to all the essential workers for their service and sacrifice.",CHAIR POWELL.
3,The danger to the U.S. economy was also clear.,CHAIR POWELL.
4,"Congress provided by far the fastest and largest response to any postwar economic downturn, offering fiscal support for households, businesses, health-care providers, and state and local governments.",CHAIR POWELL.
5,"Here at the Federal Reserve, we rapidly deployed our full range of tools to provide relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy.",CHAIR POWELL.
6,We are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us:  maximum employment and price stability.,CHAIR POWELL.
7,"The economic fallout has been real and widespread, but with the benefit of perspective, we can say that some of the very worst economic outcomes have been avoided by swift and forceful action—from Congress, from across government, and in cities and towns across the country.",CHAIR POWELL.
8,"More people held on to their jobs, more businesses kept their doors open, and more incomes were saved as a result of these swift and forceful policy actions.",CHAIR POWELL.
9,"And while we welcome these positive developments, no one should be complacent.",CHAIR POWELL.
10,"At the Fed, we will continue to provide the economy the support that it needs for as long as it takes.",CHAIR POWELL.
11,Today the FOMC kept interest rates near zero and maintained our sizable asset purchases.,CHAIR POWELL.
12,"These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete.",CHAIR POWELL.
13,The path of the economy continues to depend significantly on the course of the virus and the measures undertaken to control its spread.,CHAIR POWELL.
14,"Since January, the number of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths has fallen, and ongoing vaccinations offer hope for a return to more normal conditions later this year.",CHAIR POWELL.
15,"In the meantime, continued observance of social-distancing measures and wearing masks will help us reach that goal as soon as possible.",CHAIR POWELL.
16,"The economic recovery remains uneven and far from complete, and the path ahead remains uncertain.",CHAIR POWELL.
17,"Following the moderation in the pace of the recovery that began toward the end of last year, indicators of economic activity and employment have turned up recently, although the sectors of the economy most adversely affected by the resurgence of the virus and by greater social distancing remain weak.",CHAIR POWELL.
18,Household spending on goods has risen notably so far this year.,CHAIR POWELL.
19,"In contrast, household spending on services remains low, especially in services that typically require people to gather closely, including travel and hospitality.",CHAIR POWELL.
20,"The housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn, while business investment and manufacturing production have also picked up.",CHAIR POWELL.
21,"The overall recovery in economic activity since last spring is due importantly to unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy actions, which have provided essential support to households, businesses, and communities.",CHAIR POWELL.
22,"The recovery has progressed more quickly than generally expected, and forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised up notably since our December Summary of Economic Projections.",CHAIR POWELL.
23,"In commenting on the stronger outlook, participants noted progress on vaccinations as well as recent fiscal policy.",CHAIR POWELL.
24,"As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have turned up recently.",CHAIR POWELL.
25,"Employment rose by 379,000 in February, as the leisure and hospitality sector recouped about two-thirds of the jobs that were lost in December and January.",CHAIR POWELL.
26,"Nonetheless, employment in this sector is more than 3 million below its level at the onset of the pandemic.",CHAIR POWELL.
27,"For the economy as a whole, employment is 9.5 million below its pre-pandemic level.",CHAIR POWELL.
28,"The unemployment rate remains elevated at 6.2 percent in February; this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market remains notably below pre-pandemic levels.",CHAIR POWELL.
29,"Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the unemployment rate to continue to decline; the median projection is 4.5 percent at the end of this year and moves down to 3.5 percent by the end of 2023.",CHAIR POWELL.
30,"The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit.",CHAIR POWELL.
31,"In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers in the service sector and for African Americans and Hispanics.",CHAIR POWELL.
32,The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future.,CHAIR POWELL.
33,Overall inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective.,CHAIR POWELL.
34,"Over the next few months, 12-month measures of inflation will move up as the very low readings from March and April of last year fall out of the calculation.",CHAIR POWELL.
35,"Beyond these base effects, we could also see upward pressure on prices if spending rebounds quickly as the economy continues to reopen, particularly if supply bottlenecks limit how quickly production can respond in the near term.",CHAIR POWELL.
36,"However, these one-time increases in prices are likely to have only transient effects on inflation.",CHAIR POWELL.
37,The median inflation projection of FOMC participants is 2.4 percent this year and declines to 2 percent next year before moving back up by the end of 2023.,CHAIR POWELL.
38,"The Fed’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the financial—the stability of the financial system.",CHAIR POWELL.
39,"As we say in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a “broad-based and inclusive goal.”  Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent.",CHAIR POWELL.
40,"As the Committee reiterated in today’s policy statement, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.",CHAIR POWELL.
41,We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved.,CHAIR POWELL.
42,"With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.",CHAIR POWELL.
43,"I would note that a transitory rise in inflation above 2 percent, as seems likely to occur this year, would not meet this standard.",CHAIR POWELL.
44,"In addition, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.",CHAIR POWELL.
45,The increase in our balance sheet since last March has materially eased financial conditions and is providing substantial support to the economy.,CHAIR POWELL.
46,"The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved.",CHAIR POWELL.
47,"Our forward guidance for the federal funds rate, along with our balance sheet guidance, will ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the recovery progresses.",CHAIR POWELL.
48,Our guidance is outcome based and ties the path of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet to progress toward reaching our employment and inflation goals.,CHAIR POWELL.
49,"Overall, our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and will continue to do so.",CHAIR POWELL.
50,"To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.",CHAIR POWELL.
51,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.,CHAIR POWELL.
52,We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.,CHAIR POWELL.
53,Thank you.,CHAIR POWELL.
54,I look forward to your questions.,CHAIR POWELL.
55,Howard from Reuters.,JOE PAVEL.
56,"Hi, Chair Powell, and, and thanks for that.",HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
57,"So could you talk us through how the, the forecasts for 2021 map into the “substantial further progress” definition—you know, 2.4 percent inflation—I understand that’s considered transitory.",HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
58,"That still seems like some progress there, 4½ percent unemployment.",HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
59,Is it time to start talking about talking about tapering yet?,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
60,[Laughter]  Not yet.,CHAIR POWELL.
61,"So, as you—as you pointed out, we’ve said that we would continue asset purchases at this pace until we see substantial further progress.",CHAIR POWELL.
62,"And that’s actual progress, not forecast progress.",CHAIR POWELL.
63,"So—and that’s a difference from, from our past approach.",CHAIR POWELL.
64,"So—and what we mean by that is, is pretty straightforward.",CHAIR POWELL.
65,"It is, we want to see that, that the labor markets have moved—labor market conditions have moved—you know, have made substantial progress toward maximum employment, and inflation has made substantial progress toward the 2 percent goal.",CHAIR POWELL.
66,That’s what we’re going to want to see.,CHAIR POWELL.
67,"Now, that obviously includes an element of judgment.",CHAIR POWELL.
68,And when we see—we’ll be—we’ll be carefully looking ahead.,CHAIR POWELL.
69,"We, we also understand that we, we will want to provide as much advance notice of any potential taper as possible.",CHAIR POWELL.
70,"So when we see that we’re on track, when we see actual data coming in that suggests that we’re on track to perhaps achieve substantial further progress, then we’ll say so.",CHAIR POWELL.
71,And we’ll say so well in advance of any decision to actually taper.,CHAIR POWELL.
72,"If, if I could follow up on that, this shift in the dots—why wouldn’t that suggest a weakening of the commitment here?",HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
73,"An awful lot of people shifted into 2022, it seems.",HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
74,"I, I don’t see that at all.",CHAIR POWELL.
75,"You know, we, we have a, a range of perspectives on the Committee.",CHAIR POWELL.
76,I welcome that.,CHAIR POWELL.
77,"And, you know, we, we have—we debate things, we discuss things, and we always come together around a—around a, a solution.",CHAIR POWELL.
78,"But, you know, the, the strong bulk of the Committee is, is not showing a rate increase during this forecast period.",CHAIR POWELL.
79,"And, you know, as, as data improve, as the outlook improves very significantly since the December meeting, you would expect forecasts to move up.",CHAIR POWELL.
80,It’s probably not a surprise that some people would bring in their estimate of the appropriate time for liftoff.,CHAIR POWELL.
81,"Nonetheless, you know, the bulk of the Committee—the, the largest part by far of the Committee is, is—doesn’t show a rate increase during this period.",CHAIR POWELL.
82,"And, again, part of that is wanting to see actual data rather than just a forecast at this point.",CHAIR POWELL.
83,"We do expect that we’ll begin to make faster progress on both spending—you know, labor markets and inflation as the year goes on because of the progress with the vaccines, because of the fiscal support that we’re getting.",CHAIR POWELL.
84,We expect that to happen.,CHAIR POWELL.
85,"But, you know, we’ll have to see it first.",CHAIR POWELL.
86,"Great, thank you.",MICHELLE SMITH.
87,Victoria.,MICHELLE SMITH.
88,"Hi, Chair Powell.",VICTORIA GUIDA.
89,I wanted to ask about the supplementary leverage ratio.,VICTORIA GUIDA.
90,"You know, there’s been a lot of talk about what you all are going to do this month, which—I’m happy to hear an update if you have one.",VICTORIA GUIDA.
91,"But just sort of more broadly, do you think, long term, that the leverage ratio poses problems for implementing monetary policy at a time when the reserve supply is going to remain large?",VICTORIA GUIDA.
92,"And, if so, do you think the changes to the leverage ratio, including the SLR, are the way to deal with that problem?",VICTORIA GUIDA.
93,"Victoria, we’ll have something to announce on that in coming days.",CHAIR POWELL.
94,And I’m not going to expound upon your questions.,CHAIR POWELL.
95,Why don’t you—why don’t you ask another question if you’d like to?,CHAIR POWELL.
96,"Because, because that one—I’m just going to say that we’ll have something in coming days.",CHAIR POWELL.
97,Sure.,VICTORIA GUIDA.
98,Okay.,VICTORIA GUIDA.
99,"Well, then I’ll ask about unemployment.",VICTORIA GUIDA.
100,"You know, there’s—the unemployment rate is—you all have projections for the U-6 rate, but you’ve also been, you know, really emphasizing the fact that that’s not the only thing that you all are looking at.",VICTORIA GUIDA.
101,You’re also looking at labor force participation and things like that.,VICTORIA GUIDA.
102,So are you all looking at ways of maybe adding to how you’re projecting the unemployment rate to the Summary of Economic Projections?,VICTORIA GUIDA.
103,"Well, let me say, as we say in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we look to a range of indicators on the labor market.",CHAIR POWELL.
104,"We never only looked at the unemployment rate, which is the only indicator of, of labor market outcomes that’s in the SEP.  We look at a very broad range.",CHAIR POWELL.
105,"You hear us talk all the time about participation; about employment to population, which is the combination of the two; about different measures of, of unemployment.",CHAIR POWELL.
106,"So it’s wages, it’s, it’s the job flows, it’s, you know, all of those things.",CHAIR POWELL.
107,They go into an assessment—disparities of various groups.,CHAIR POWELL.
108,All that goes into an assessment of maximum employment.,CHAIR POWELL.
109,"The, the—trying to incorporate all of that into the Summary of Economic Projections would not be practical.",CHAIR POWELL.
110,"You know, obviously, the thing that we do include is just the unemployment rate, and that’s a very insufficient statistic.",CHAIR POWELL.
111,"So—it, it doesn’t include a lot of other things that we—that we do look at.",CHAIR POWELL.
112,"And I, I wouldn’t want to say that we’re looking to include the other dozen things that we look at into the SEP.",CHAIR POWELL.
113,"But at time—from time to time, we do look at, at adding different things.",CHAIR POWELL.
114,"But I, I would just say the SEP is, it’s a summary.",CHAIR POWELL.
115,It’s one device.,CHAIR POWELL.
116,It’s not going to include all of the things that we look at.,CHAIR POWELL.
117,"I think you know the things that we look at—we, we talk about them all the time.",CHAIR POWELL.
118,So we’re not actually looking actively at significantly broadening those indicators in the SEP right now.,CHAIR POWELL.
119,Thank you.,MICHELLE SMITH.
120,"Chris Rugaber, Associated Press.",MICHELLE SMITH.
121,Thank you.,CHRIS RUGABER.
122,"Chair Powell, I wanted to ask about the forecast overall.",CHRIS RUGABER.
123,"You’re forecasting a very low unemployment rate next year and in 2023, you have inflation—or, the Fed overall is, in the SEP, forecasting inflation at or above 2 percent by 2023, yet no rate hike in any of this—in any of this forecast horizon.",CHRIS RUGABER.
124,So is this telling us that we could see a higher inflation rate than was projected?,CHRIS RUGABER.
125,"Or do you not—as you’ve been talking about, is the unemployment rate insufficient?",CHRIS RUGABER.
126,"Or what is this telling us about the Fed’s reaction function, that it seems you’re meeting the Fed’s dual mandate by 2023, yet, again, no rate hike expected?",CHRIS RUGABER.
127,"So I guess the first thing to say is that the, the SEP is not a Committee forecast.",CHAIR POWELL.
128,"It’s, it’s not something we sit around and debate and discuss and approve, and say, “This represents our, you know, our reaction function as a Committee.”  It’s a compilation of projections from different people.",CHAIR POWELL.
129,"And I—since we don’t debate it or discuss it, it would be hard for me to say why—exactly why each participant did what they were going to do.",CHAIR POWELL.
130,So all I would say about this is that we’ve—we laid out what I think is very clear guidance on liftoff.,CHAIR POWELL.
131,"And it’s really three things:  labor market conditions that are consistent with our estimates of maximum employment—and, as I mentioned, we consider a wide range of indicators in assessing labor market conditions, not just the unemployment rate; inflation that has reached 2 percent, and not just on a transitory basis; and inflation that’s on track to run moderately above 2 percent for some time.",CHAIR POWELL.
132,The first two of those three are very much data based; the third does have a little bit of a—of an element of expectations in it.,CHAIR POWELL.
133,So we are very much determined to implement this guidance in a robust way.,CHAIR POWELL.
134,It is the guidance that we chose carefully to implement our new framework.,CHAIR POWELL.
135,"And to meet these standards, we’ll need to see data, as I mentioned.",CHAIR POWELL.
136,"So what does—what does this, this SEP really say?",CHAIR POWELL.
137,It says that we’re committed to our framework and to the guidance we’ve provided to implement that framework.,CHAIR POWELL.
138,We will wait until the requirements set forth in that guidance are clearly met before considering a change in our policy rate.,CHAIR POWELL.
139,"And the last thing I’ll say is this:  The state of the economy in two or three years is highly uncertain, and I wouldn’t want to focus too much on the exact timing of a potential rate increase that far into the future.",CHAIR POWELL.
140,"So that’s how I would think about the, the SEP. MICHELLE SMITH.",CHAIR POWELL.
141,Thank you.,CHAIR POWELL.
142,Paul Kiernan.,CHAIR POWELL.
143,"Thank you, Chairman Powell.",PAUL KIERNAN.
144,My question is twofold.,PAUL KIERNAN.
145,"One, how high are you comfortable letting inflation rise?",PAUL KIERNAN.
146,"There, there is some ambiguity in, in your new target, as you mentioned, “expectations driven.”  And, and do you think that that ambiguity might cause markets to price in a lower tolerance for inflation than the Fed actually has, thereby causing financial conditions to tighten prematurely?",PAUL KIERNAN.
147,Is that a concern?,PAUL KIERNAN.
148,Thanks.,PAUL KIERNAN.
149,So we’ve said we’d like to see inflation run moderately above 2 percent for some time.,CHAIR POWELL.
150,"And we’ve resisted, basically, generally, the temptation to try to quantify that.",CHAIR POWELL.
151,"Part of that just is, talking about inflation is one thing; actually having inflation run above 2 percent is the real thing.",CHAIR POWELL.
152,"So I—you know, over the years we’ve, we’ve talked about 2 percent inflation as a goal, but we haven’t achieved it.",CHAIR POWELL.
153,"So I, I would say we’d like to, you know, perform.",CHAIR POWELL.
154,"That’s what we’d really like to do, is to get inflation moderately above 2 percent.",CHAIR POWELL.
155,"I don’t want to be too specific about what that means, because I think it’s hard to do that.",CHAIR POWELL.
156,And we haven’t done it yet.,CHAIR POWELL.
157,"You know, when we’re actually above 2 percent, we can do that.",CHAIR POWELL.
158,"I—look, I, I would say this.",CHAIR POWELL.
159,"The fundamental change in, in our framework is that we, we’re not going to act preemptively based on forecasts for the most part.",CHAIR POWELL.
160,And we’re going to wait to see actual data.,CHAIR POWELL.
161,"And I think it will take people time to, to adjust to that—and to adjust to that new practice.",CHAIR POWELL.
162,And the only way we can really build the credibility of that is by doing it.,CHAIR POWELL.
163,So that’s how I would think about that.,CHAIR POWELL.
164,Thank you.,MICHELLE SMITH.
165,Matthew Boesler.,MICHELLE SMITH.
166,"Hi, Chair Powell.",MATTHEW BOESLER.
167,This is Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg News.,MATTHEW BOESLER.
168,So there’s a widespread presumption at this point that the U.S. will reach herd immunity sometime this year.,MATTHEW BOESLER.
169,"And all along, you’ve said that the path of the economy is going to be determined by the course of the virus.",MATTHEW BOESLER.
170,"I’m curious, based on the projections that you released today that show unemployment will still be above estimates of maximum employment through the end of next year and perhaps sometime into 2023, do you think policymakers need to be doing more here to sort of align the herd immunity and full employment timelines, if you will?",MATTHEW BOESLER.
171,Thank you.,MATTHEW BOESLER.
172,"So, on, on herd immunity, I, I’m really going to leave that question to the experts.",CHAIR POWELL.
173,We don’t control that.,CHAIR POWELL.
174,We’re not responsible for defining it.,CHAIR POWELL.
175,"And we’ll, we’ll leave that whole discussion to the experts.",CHAIR POWELL.
176,"I mean, we’re—what we’re focused on is, is the part that we control, which is the support that we provide to the economy.",CHAIR POWELL.
177,And there we’ve provided very clear guidance.,CHAIR POWELL.
178,"And in the case of asset purchases, it’s at their current level until we make substantial further progress.",CHAIR POWELL.
179,"There is an element of judgment in that, and we’ll, we’ll—therefore, we’ll supply clear communication well in advance of, of actually tapering, and we just went through, you know, the, the criteria for raising interest rates.",CHAIR POWELL.
180,They’re very specific.,CHAIR POWELL.
181,"And, you know, we’re, we’re very much committed to having them fulfilled robustly.",CHAIR POWELL.
182,"I, I would agree with you that the, the path of the virus continues to be very important.",CHAIR POWELL.
183,"We, we have these, you know, new strains with—which, which can be quite virulent.",CHAIR POWELL.
184,And we’re not actually done yet.,CHAIR POWELL.
185,"And I, I—we’re clearly on a good path with, with cases coming down, as I mentioned, but we’re not done.",CHAIR POWELL.
186,And I’d hate to see us take our eye off the ball before we actually finish the job.,CHAIR POWELL.
187,So that’s how I would look at that.,CHAIR POWELL.
188,"If I could just briefly follow up, how do you see sort of the disconnect in terms of an economy that is expected to be widely reopened this year but full employment taking longer to achieve?",MATTHEW BOESLER.
189,"Is it, is it the case that factors related to the virus will still be with us over the coming years?",MATTHEW BOESLER.
190,Is that how to interpret the forecasts?,MATTHEW BOESLER.
191,I think there’s some of that.,CHAIR POWELL.
192,"Sure, there’ll be some of that.",CHAIR POWELL.
193,There will still be some social distancing.,CHAIR POWELL.
194,"People may be, for example, going into spaces that, that, you know, that involve close contact with others.",CHAIR POWELL.
195,Some people will do that right away.,CHAIR POWELL.
196,Others will hold back.,CHAIR POWELL.
197,And so I think there’ll—there’ll be some of that.,CHAIR POWELL.
198,"In addition, though, remember, there are—there are 10 million people—in the range of 10 million people who need to get back to work.",CHAIR POWELL.
199,And it’s going to take some time for that to happen.,CHAIR POWELL.
200,"You know, it can—it can happen maybe, maybe more quickly than it has in the past, because it involves the reopening of a sector of the economy, as opposed to stimulating aggregate demand and waiting for that to produce job demand for workers.",CHAIR POWELL.
201,This could be a different sort of a process.,CHAIR POWELL.
202,And it could be quicker.,CHAIR POWELL.
203,We don’t know that.,CHAIR POWELL.
204,"But it’s, it’s just a lot of people who have—who need to get back to work.",CHAIR POWELL.
205,And it’s not going to happen overnight.,CHAIR POWELL.
206,It would be—it’s going to take some time.,CHAIR POWELL.
207,"No matter how well the economy performs, unemployment will take quite a time to go—to go down, and so will participation.",CHAIR POWELL.
208,So that’s all I can say.,CHAIR POWELL.
209,I think the faster the better; we’d love to see it come sooner rather than later.,CHAIR POWELL.
210,We’d welcome nothing more than that.,CHAIR POWELL.
211,"But, realistically, given the numbers, it’s going to take some time.",CHAIR POWELL.
212,"Thank you, Steve Liesman.",MICHELLE SMITH.
213,"Mr. Chairman, thank you.",STEVE LIESMAN.
214,"I wonder if you could—kind of a three-parter here, but all related.",STEVE LIESMAN.
215,"Would you comment on the current level of the 10-year yield and some other long rates out there, whether or not you think they would have a negative effect on the economy?",STEVE LIESMAN.
216,"And, if not, is there a level that would give you concern?",STEVE LIESMAN.
217,"And, finally, the third part:  Other central bankers have expressed concern about what’s happened to yields in their countries and even some taken action, but not you.",STEVE LIESMAN.
218,"Could you give us your general idea or orientation towards the idea of, of coming into the market and affecting a particular tenor of the bond market?",STEVE LIESMAN.
219,Do—do you like that idea?,STEVE LIESMAN.
220,Do you not like it?,STEVE LIESMAN.
221,"Is it at the top of your toolbox, or is it something that you think is at the bottom of the toolbox?",STEVE LIESMAN.
222,Sure.,CHAIR POWELL.
223,"So we monitor a broad range of financial conditions, and we’re always attentive to market developments, of course.",CHAIR POWELL.
224,"We’re still a long way from our goals, and it’s important that financial conditions do remain accommodative to support the achievement of those goals.",CHAIR POWELL.
225,"And if you look at various indexes of financial conditions, what you’ll see is that they generally do show financial conditions overall to be highly accommodative.",CHAIR POWELL.
226,And that is appropriate.,CHAIR POWELL.
227,"So that’s, that’s how we look at it.",CHAIR POWELL.
228,"I would add, as I’ve said, I would be concerned by disorderly conditions in markets or by a persistent tightening of financial conditions that threaten the achievement of our goals.",CHAIR POWELL.
229,We think the stance of our—of monetary policy remains appropriate.,CHAIR POWELL.
230,Our guidance on the federal funds rate and on asset purchases is providing strong support for the economy.,CHAIR POWELL.
231,And we’re committed to maintaining that patiently accommodative stance until the job is well and truly done.,CHAIR POWELL.
232,"Could, could you give us an idea of how you sort of feel about that tool, of being able to come into a particular part of the market and either operating—doing an Operation Twist or something like that?",STEVE LIESMAN.
233,Is that something you feel to be the top of your toolbox or something that you don’t really prefer?,STEVE LIESMAN.
234,"You know, we—the tools we have are the tools we have.",CHAIR POWELL.
235,"What I’m telling you is that the stance of monetary policy we have today, we believe, is appropriate.",CHAIR POWELL.
236,"We think that our asset purchases in their current form—which is to say, you know, across the curve, $80 billion in Treasuries, $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities on net—we think that that’s, that’s the right place for our asset purchases.",CHAIR POWELL.
237,"Now, we can—we can change them, of course, in, in a number of different dimensions should we deem that that’s appropriate.",CHAIR POWELL.
238,"But, for now, we think that our policy stance on that is appropriate.",CHAIR POWELL.
239,Thank you.,MICHELLE SMITH.
240,Rachel Siegel.,MICHELLE SMITH.
241,"Hi, Chair Powell.",RACHEL SIEGEL.
242,Thanks very much for taking my question.,RACHEL SIEGEL.
243,"You’ve spoken about the pandemic’s disproportionate toll on Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and other groups in the labor market.",RACHEL SIEGEL.
244,And I’m curious if you can speak to specific indicators that the Fed will be using to measure job gains for groups that have persistently higher rates of unemployment compared to white Americans.,RACHEL SIEGEL.
245,"And, relatedly, since you’ve described vaccines as key to the economic recovery, is the Fed concerned about lower vaccination rates in communities of color?",RACHEL SIEGEL.
246,And what barriers do you think exist there?,RACHEL SIEGEL.
247,Thanks very much.,RACHEL SIEGEL.
248,"So, which measures.",CHAIR POWELL.
249,"So we, we do monitor and communicate very regularly about different labor market—disparities in the labor market, let’s say.",CHAIR POWELL.
250,"So the African American unemployment rate is substantially elevated, and so is the Hispanic unemployment rate.",CHAIR POWELL.
251,"So we look at those and we see those as, you know—it’s, it’s slack in the labor market.",CHAIR POWELL.
252,"It’s, it’s sad to see, because those disparities had really come down to record lows since we started keeping the data that way.",CHAIR POWELL.
253,"As recently as a year ago, February of last year, we had those, those disparities quite low.",CHAIR POWELL.
254,"What happens in a downturn, though, is they move up at twice the speed of white unemployment.",CHAIR POWELL.
255,So we monitor those things.,CHAIR POWELL.
256,"We—our tools, of course, affect unemployment generally, but we’re going to look at those as, as a form of slack in the labor market and hope that, you know, that there’s progress there.",CHAIR POWELL.
257,"And, and this particular downturn, of course, was just a direct hit on, on a part of the economy that employs many minorities and lower-paid workers.",CHAIR POWELL.
258,"The public-facing workers in the service industries in many cases don’t have a lot of financial assets, they’re not tremendously well paid, they might have other jobs, and things like that.",CHAIR POWELL.
259,So this was a direct hit on that part of the economy.,CHAIR POWELL.
260,And it’s the slowest part of the economy to recover.,CHAIR POWELL.
261,"So, you know, we’d like to see those people continue to get supported, you know, as we—as the broader economy recovers, which, which it’s very much doing now.",CHAIR POWELL.
262,"In terms of disparate levels of vaccination, that’s—those are facts and unfortunate facts.",CHAIR POWELL.
263,"They’re really not something we, we have within our policy toolkit to address.",CHAIR POWELL.
264,"But it is—it is true, though, that the data we have suggests that there are—there are significant disparities between different ethnic groups and—you know, but that’s, that’s not for us.",CHAIR POWELL.
265,"That’s for fiscal authorities and the government more generally to, to work on.",CHAIR POWELL.
266,Thank you.,MICHELLE SMITH.
267,Jeanna Smialek.,MICHELLE SMITH.
268,"Hey, Chair Powell.",JEANNA SMIALEK.
269,Thanks for taking our questions.,JEANNA SMIALEK.
270,"I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you see the fiscal policy support that has come down the line affecting the economy’s potential in the longer term, just in the sense that you’ve talked a lot about the potential for labor market scarring and how that might weigh on our, sort of, future prospects.",JEANNA SMIALEK.
271,And I wonder whether you see that sort of working in reverse.,JEANNA SMIALEK.
272,"You know, if we put people back into the labor market more quickly, does that improve our chances?",JEANNA SMIALEK.
273,"So I do think that fiscal policy overall will have really helped us to avoid much of the scarring that we were very, very concerned about at the beginning.",CHAIR POWELL.
274,"And I think that’s just the size and the speed with which Congress has delivered—you know, with the CARES Act and since then, has—is going to wind up very much accelerating the return to full employment.",CHAIR POWELL.
275,It’s going to make a huge difference in people’s lives.,CHAIR POWELL.
276,And it has already.,CHAIR POWELL.
277,"As I mentioned in my remarks—opening remarks, the recovery has been faster than we expected.",CHAIR POWELL.
278,"Part of that just is, it’s very hard to predict, given we’ve never seen an event like this.",CHAIR POWELL.
279,"But part of it is just the strength of the fiscal response, which I think will, will look good over the years.",CHAIR POWELL.
280,"Longer term, you know, to, to really—that’s—the first part of it is about avoiding scarring, and I think we’ve not avoided all of the scarring, but we’ve probably avoided the worst cases there.",CHAIR POWELL.
281,"And, and I hope we keep at it, and we will keep at it with our policies, of course, to do whatever we can to make sure that’s—that continues.",CHAIR POWELL.
282,"Longer term though, what it takes to drive productive capacity per capita or per hour worked, to raise living standards over time, is investment:  investment in people’s skills and aptitudes, investment in plant and equipment, investment in software.",CHAIR POWELL.
283,"It takes a lot of investment to, to support a more productive economy and raise living standards.",CHAIR POWELL.
284,"And that’s—you know, that hasn’t been the principal focus with these measures—our measures, certainly.",CHAIR POWELL.
285,And we don’t have those tools.,CHAIR POWELL.
286,"But what Congress has been doing has mainly been replacing lost income and beginning to, you know, support people as the economy returns to normal.",CHAIR POWELL.
287,"But there should be a focus on—a longer-term focus, I think, would be healthy on, on the investment front.",CHAIR POWELL.
288,Thank you.,MICHELLE SMITH.
289,James Politi.,MICHELLE SMITH.
290,"Thank you, Chair Powell.",JAMES POLITI.
291,I wanted to ask a question about the euro zone.,JAMES POLITI.
292,"While the outlook for the U.S. economy has much improved, progress in the euro zone has been far less encouraging.",JAMES POLITI.
293,"And it’s showing signs of serious weakness due, due to the slower vaccination rollout and renewed lockdowns and restrictions.",JAMES POLITI.
294,"How worried are you about transatlantic economic divergence and the possibility that, that trouble in the euro zone and weakness in the euro zone could, could drag down the U.S. recovery as it did, in a way, in the aftermath of the financial crisis?",JAMES POLITI.
295,"You’re right that the pace of the recovery is that we’re having diverging recoveries here, as we did after the last crisis.",CHAIR POWELL.
296,"And in this case, as well as the other one, the U.S.’s recovery is, is leading the global recovery.",CHAIR POWELL.
297,"And, you know, we conduct policy, of course, here.",CHAIR POWELL.
298,"Our, our focus is on—our, you know—our, our objectives are domestic ones.",CHAIR POWELL.
299,"It’s, it’s maximum employment and price stability here in the United States.",CHAIR POWELL.
300,"We monitor developments abroad, and we know—because they know we know that they can—those can affect our outcomes.",CHAIR POWELL.
301,"So I think U.S. demand—very strong U.S. demand, if, if—as the economy improves is going to support global activity as well over time.",CHAIR POWELL.
302,"That, that’ll be through imports.",CHAIR POWELL.
303,"And, you know, when the U.S. economy is strong, that strength tends to be—tends to support global, global activity as well.",CHAIR POWELL.
304,So that’s one thing.,CHAIR POWELL.
305,I don’t—I don’t worry in the near term.,CHAIR POWELL.
306,"I mean, I’d love to see Europe growing faster.",CHAIR POWELL.
307,I’d love to see the vaccine rollout going more smoothly.,CHAIR POWELL.
308,"But I don’t worry too much about us in the near term, because we’re, we’re on a very good track.",CHAIR POWELL.
309,"Very strong fiscal support coming, now vaccination going quickly, and cases coming down.",CHAIR POWELL.
310,I think we’re—I think we’re in a good place.,CHAIR POWELL.
311,"It’s all ahead of us, but the data should, should get stronger fairly quickly here and remain strong for some time here.",CHAIR POWELL.
312,Thank you.,MICHELLE SMITH.
313,Hannah Lang.,MICHELLE SMITH.
314,"Hi, thanks so much for taking our questions.",HANNAH LANG.
315,"I wanted to ask if the Fed is planning on extending the same restrictions on bank dividends and share repurchases—I’m sorry, share repurchases that are currently in place into the second quarter, and if you’re considering at all the scenario analysis and midcycle stress tests that were in place last year, this year.",HANNAH LANG.
316,"And, kind of, what would make you consider doing something like that again?",HANNAH LANG.
317,So we haven’t made a decision on that.,CHAIR POWELL.
318,We’re a couple weeks away from announcing that decision.,CHAIR POWELL.
319,"I, I won’t foreshadow it here today.",CHAIR POWELL.
320,"I will say, we’re going to continue our data-driven approach.",CHAIR POWELL.
321,"You know that we restricted buybacks and dividends, so the firms are preserving capital.",CHAIR POWELL.
322,"Through 2020, the banks actually increased their level of capital and their level of reserves.",CHAIR POWELL.
323,"And the December stress tests showed that banks are strong and well capitalized under our hypothetical recessions that we—that we used in December, which were quite stringent.",CHAIR POWELL.
324,"We’re right in the middle of our 2021 stress tests, and we’ll release those results before the end of June.",CHAIR POWELL.
325,"And that layers, you know, very significant additional stress on top of the stress the banks have already absorbed over the past year, with the unemployment rate going to 11 percent and stock prices falling more than 50 percent.",CHAIR POWELL.
326,"So—but all of that, you know, the results of the stress tests and the decision on distributions—all of that is to come fairly soon, as I mentioned.",CHAIR POWELL.
327,Thank you.,MICHELLE SMITH.
328,Edward Lawrence.,MICHELLE SMITH.
329,"Thanks, Chair Powell, for taking these questions.",EDWARD LAWRENCE.
330,You laid out the standards to lift off.,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
331,"And back in June of 2020, you said, you know, you’re not even thinking about thinking about raising rates.",EDWARD LAWRENCE.
332,But I see seven members seeing liftoff in 2023 and 4 next year.,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
333,"How, how much debate—and how can you characterize that conversation—has there been about moving off the lower bound earlier than signaled?",EDWARD LAWRENCE.
334,"Well, you know, it all depends.",CHAIR POWELL.
335,"We’ve set out very clear criteria for liftoff, right, where we’ve said we want to see labor market conditions that are consistent with our estimates of, of maximum employment.",CHAIR POWELL.
336,"And that doesn’t just mean unemployment, it means a much broader set of criteria.",CHAIR POWELL.
337,"We want inflation at 2 percent, and not on a transitory basis.",CHAIR POWELL.
338,And we want inflation on track to be moderately—to run moderately above 2 percent for some time.,CHAIR POWELL.
339,Those are the three conditions.,CHAIR POWELL.
340,"Everybody on the Committee agrees to that, right?",CHAIR POWELL.
341,"So it comes down to, what’s your projection for the economy?",CHAIR POWELL.
342,"If you want to—if you want to—you know, people will have a range of, of assessments for how good the economy is going to be.",CHAIR POWELL.
343,"And, you know, we, we don’t—I would say that we’re in a relatively highly uncertain situation.",CHAIR POWELL.
344,"If you look at the uncertainty, people, people on the Committee broadly say that uncertainty about the forecast is, is very high compared to the normal level.",CHAIR POWELL.
345,We haven’t come out of a pandemic before.,CHAIR POWELL.
346,"We haven’t had this kind of fiscal support before, totaling it all up.",CHAIR POWELL.
347,"So you’re going to have different perspectives from Committee participants about how fast growth will be, how fast the labor market will heal, or how fast—sorry, inflation will move up.",CHAIR POWELL.
348,And those things are going to dictate where people write down an estimate of liftoff.,CHAIR POWELL.
349,"Of course, this isn’t a decision to lift off now.",CHAIR POWELL.
350,We’ll make that decision then.,CHAIR POWELL.
351,But it’s an estimate based on—based on assumptions about growth.,CHAIR POWELL.
352,"And it’s, it’s meant to be a tool to generally show the public how, how our objective function works, how we think about the future.",CHAIR POWELL.
353,It isn’t meant to actually pin down a time when we might or might not lift off.,CHAIR POWELL.
354,"We—you know, we’re not going to make that decision for some time.",CHAIR POWELL.
355,The chances are that the economy in that time and place will be very different from the one we think it’ll be.,CHAIR POWELL.
356,"So I—sometimes with the dots, I have to be sure to point out that they—they’re not a Committee forecast.",CHAIR POWELL.
357,"And you know this, but it’s—they’re not a Committee forecast.",CHAIR POWELL.
358,"It’s just compiling these projections, really, of individual people.",CHAIR POWELL.
359,We think it serves a useful purpose.,CHAIR POWELL.
360,"It’s not meant to, to actually be a promise or even a prediction of when the Committee will act.",CHAIR POWELL.
361,"That will be very much dependent on economic outcomes, which are highly uncertain.",CHAIR POWELL.
362,Thank you.,MICHELLE SMITH.
363,We’ll go to Brian Cheung.,MICHELLE SMITH.
364,"Hey there, Chairman Powell.",BRIAN CHEUNG.
365,I wanted to elaborate a little bit on your commentary about the fiscal stimulus.,BRIAN CHEUNG.
366,"So it sounds like you, I guess, see the case for even maybe more investment, at least from Congress, to support the more productive economy, as you answered to Jeanna’s question.",BRIAN CHEUNG.
367,So we just had $1.9 trillion dollars in spending.,BRIAN CHEUNG.
368,So where do you see the fiscal space right now?,BRIAN CHEUNG.
369,"Do you still, I guess, maybe see the country in a place right now where it wouldn’t be a concern if there were to be more spending at this time?",BRIAN CHEUNG.
370,"So, Brian, it’s not up to us to decide what, what Congress should spend money on or when.",CHAIR POWELL.
371,"I was answering Jeanna’s question, which really was, how do we assure lack of damage to—scarring, for example, or lack of damage to the productive capacity of the economy?",CHAIR POWELL.
372,And I think what’s happened so far has done a pretty good job of that.,CHAIR POWELL.
373,"But, really, I wanted to make the longer-run point that if—to work on the productivity—on productivity over longer periods, that is—that is—comes down to a number of things.",CHAIR POWELL.
374,"But one of those things is investment:  investment in people, in their skills, education, aptitude, all of those things.",CHAIR POWELL.
375,I’m not in any way suggesting that that’s something Congress should work on right now.,CHAIR POWELL.
376,"Or that, you know, that’s just not my—that’s not our job.",CHAIR POWELL.
377,"I’m just saying, that, that is what fiscal policy can do that, really, monetary policy can’t do—is, is invest in the future productive capacity of the economy, raise potential growth.",CHAIR POWELL.
378,Those things are completely tools that Congress has.,CHAIR POWELL.
379,"And, again, I wasn’t making a comment at all on the current fiscal setting.",CHAIR POWELL.
380,Thank you.,MICHELLE SMITH.
381,Next to Michael Derby.,MICHELLE SMITH.
382,Thank you for taking my question.,MICHAEL DERBY.
383,"I just wanted to get your—an updated view on your sense of your view on financial stability risks and whether or not you see any pockets of excess out in financial markets that concern you, either, you know, specifically to that, that area of the market or as in terms of, like, the threat that it could pose to—propose to the overall economy.",MICHAEL DERBY.
384,Sure.,CHAIR POWELL.
385,"So, as you know, financial stability for us is, is a framework.",CHAIR POWELL.
386,It’s not one thing.,CHAIR POWELL.
387,It’s not a particular market or a particular asset or anything like that.,CHAIR POWELL.
388,"It’s a framework that we, we have.",CHAIR POWELL.
389,"We report on it semiannually, the Board gets a report on it quarterly, and we monitor every day.",CHAIR POWELL.
390,"And it has—it has four pillars, and those are four key vulnerabilities:  asset valuations, debt owed by businesses and households, funding risk, and leverage among financial institutions.",CHAIR POWELL.
391,Those four things.,CHAIR POWELL.
392,And I’ll just quickly touch on them.,CHAIR POWELL.
393,"So if you look at asset valuations, you can say that by some measures, some asset valuations are elevated compared to history.",CHAIR POWELL.
394,I think that’s clear.,CHAIR POWELL.
395,"In terms of households and businesses, households entered the, the crisis in very good shape by historical standards.",CHAIR POWELL.
396,Leverage in the household sector had been just kind of gradually moving down and down and down since the—since the financial crisis.,CHAIR POWELL.
397,"Now, there was—there was some negative effects on that, people lost their jobs and that sort of thing, but they’ve also gotten a lot of support now.",CHAIR POWELL.
398,"So the damage hasn’t been as, as bad as we thought.",CHAIR POWELL.
399,"Businesses, by the same token, had a high debt load coming in.",CHAIR POWELL.
400,And—but—and many saw their revenues decline.,CHAIR POWELL.
401,"But there’s—they’ve done so much financing, and there’s a lot of cash on their balance sheet.",CHAIR POWELL.
402,So nothing in those two sectors really jumps out as really troubling.,CHAIR POWELL.
403,Short term—I mentioned funding risk as the—as the last one.,CHAIR POWELL.
404,"So we saw, again, in this crisis, breakdowns in parts of the short-term funding markets—came under a tremendous amount of stress.",CHAIR POWELL.
405,And they’ve been quiet since the spring.,CHAIR POWELL.
406,"And, you know, we shut down our facilities and all of that.",CHAIR POWELL.
407,"But we, we don’t—we don’t feel like we can let the moment pass without just saying again that we—that those—some aspects of the short-term funding markets and, more broadly, nonbank financial intermediation didn’t hold up so well under great stress—under tremendous stress.",CHAIR POWELL.
408,And we need to go back and look at that.,CHAIR POWELL.
409,"So a very high priority for us as regulators and supervisors is going to be to go back—and this, this will involve all the other regulatory agencies; it does involve all of them as well—and see if we can strengthen those things.",CHAIR POWELL.
410,"So that’s, that’s a—sort of a broader, detailed look.",CHAIR POWELL.
411,Thank you.,MICHELLE SMITH.
412,Michael McKee.,MICHELLE SMITH.
413,"Mr. Chairman, can you help me understand something about the, the SEP and your forecasts?",MICHAEL MCKEE.
414,"The inflation that you’re talking about for this year, you say, is “transitory.”  Then, by 2023, you’re back down to 2.1 percent.",MICHAEL MCKEE.
415,There’s no forecast for a rate increase for 2023.,MICHAEL MCKEE.
416,"If you get to 3½ percent unemployment but inflation is only at 2 or 2.1 percent, are you willing to leave rates at zero going forward from there—or, roughly zero going forward from there?",MICHAEL MCKEE.
417,"In other words, could we be in a Japan-like situation where rates just stay low because inflation does?",MICHAEL MCKEE.
418,"Well, again, I wouldn’t read too much into, into the, the March 2021 SEP dot plot.",CHAIR POWELL.
419,Remember what it is:  It’s a compilation of individual projections by individual members.,CHAIR POWELL.
420,They’re all making different assessments.,CHAIR POWELL.
421,"They, they have different forecasts, economic forecasts.",CHAIR POWELL.
422,"Some have more optimistic ones, some less optimistic.",CHAIR POWELL.
423,And they’re—also remember that the SEP doesn’t actually include all the things that go into maximum employment.,CHAIR POWELL.
424,Right?,CHAIR POWELL.
425,"It’s, it’s only—it only includes unemployment.",CHAIR POWELL.
426,"So I, I would just say, we’ve set out clear guidance.",CHAIR POWELL.
427,"The—the message from the SEP that I would like to leave with people is, we set out clear guidance.",CHAIR POWELL.
428,I mentioned what it was.,CHAIR POWELL.
429,"It’s inflation up to—no, sorry, it’s, it’s labor market conditions consistent with our estimates of maximum employment—and that’s not just unemployment, it’s all the other indicators, but, overall, totaling up to maximum employment; it’s inflation at 2 percent, and not on a transient basis; and inflation on track to exceed 2 percent for—moderately for some time.",CHAIR POWELL.
430,Those are the criteria.,CHAIR POWELL.
431,We’re committed to robustly implementing that guidance.,CHAIR POWELL.
432,And that’s what this—that’s what this says.,CHAIR POWELL.
433,That’s really all it says.,CHAIR POWELL.
434,We’re going to wait until those requirements are met.,CHAIR POWELL.
435,"And, again, you know, the, the state of the economy in two or three years is highly uncertain.",CHAIR POWELL.
436,And I wouldn’t want to focus too much on the exact timing of a potential rate increase that far into the future.,CHAIR POWELL.
437,"If I could follow up, I’m just wondering—before 2019, I would say you were focused on the problems with having interest rates too low.",MICHAEL MCKEE.
438,Now are you saying we’re willing to live with it until we reach these goals even if you get—meet your goal on maximum employment?,MICHAEL MCKEE.
439,"So what I would say is, we’re committed to giving the economy the support that it needs to return as quickly as possible to a state of maximum employment and price stability.",CHAIR POWELL.
440,"And, you know, to the extent having rates low and support for monetary policy broadly, to the extent that raises other questions, we think it’s absolutely essential to maintain the strength and stability of the—of the broader financial system and to carefully monitor financial stability questions if that’s what you’re getting at.",CHAIR POWELL.
441,"You know, we, we do that.",CHAIR POWELL.
442,We will—we monitor them very carefully.,CHAIR POWELL.
443,"I, I would point out that, over the long expansion—the longest in U.S. history, 10 years and 8 months—rates were very low for—they were at zero for, you know, 7 years and then—and then never got above, you know, 2.4 percent, roughly.",CHAIR POWELL.
444,"During that, we didn’t see, actually, excess buildup of debt.",CHAIR POWELL.
445,We didn’t see asset prices form into bubbles that would threaten the progress of the economy.,CHAIR POWELL.
446,We didn’t see the things you—we didn’t see a housing bubble.,CHAIR POWELL.
447,"You know, the things that have tended to really hurt an economy and have in recent history hurt the U.S., we didn’t see them build up despite very low rates.",CHAIR POWELL.
448,"Part of that just is that you’re in a low-rate environment, you’re in a much lower rate environment, and the connection between low rates and the kind of financial instability issues is just not as tight as people think it is.",CHAIR POWELL.
449,That’s not to say we ignore it.,CHAIR POWELL.
450,We don’t ignore it.,CHAIR POWELL.
451,"We, we watch it very carefully.",CHAIR POWELL.
452,And we don’t think—we think there is a connection.,CHAIR POWELL.
453,"We say there is, but it’s not quite so clear.",CHAIR POWELL.
454,"We actually monitor financial conditions very, very broadly and carefully.",CHAIR POWELL.
455,And we didn’t do that before the Global Financial Crisis 12 years ago.,CHAIR POWELL.
456,Now we do.,CHAIR POWELL.
457,"And we’ve also, you know, put a lot of time and effort into strengthening the large financial institutions that form the core of our financial system—are much stronger, much more resilient.",CHAIR POWELL.
458,That’s true of the banks.,CHAIR POWELL.
459,I think it’s true of the CCPs.,CHAIR POWELL.
460,"We want it to be true of, of other nonbank financial intermediation, markets, and, and institutions.",CHAIR POWELL.
461,"So I think that’s, that’s—you know, monetary policy should be, to me, for, for achieving our macroeconomic aims.",CHAIR POWELL.
462,"Financial regulatory policy and supervision should be for strengthening the financial system so that it is strong and robust and can withstand the kinds of things that it couldn’t, frankly—and we learned that in 2008, ’09, ’10.",CHAIR POWELL.
463,"This time around, the regulated part of the financial system held up very well.",CHAIR POWELL.
464,"We, we found some other areas that need strengthening, and that’s what we’re working on now.",CHAIR POWELL.
465,Thank you.,MICHELLE SMITH.
466,"Anneken, CNN.",MICHELLE SMITH.
467,Thanks for taking my question.,ANNEKEN TAPPE.
468,"Chairman Powell, could you talk to us a little bit about the relationship between the persistent pandemic unemployment and the expected increase in, in inflation?",ANNEKEN TAPPE.
469,Does the former offset the latter to some degree?,ANNEKEN TAPPE.
470,"I’m sorry, could you repeat that?",CHAIR POWELL.
471,You broke up there for a second.,CHAIR POWELL.
472,"Oh, no, I was hoping that wouldn’t happen.",ANNEKEN TAPPE.
473,Can you hear me now?,ANNEKEN TAPPE.
474,"Yes, yes.",CHAIR POWELL.
475,"Okay, great.",ANNEKEN TAPPE.
476,I was asking if you could talk to us a little bit about the relationship between the persistent pandemic unemployment and the expected increase in inflation.,ANNEKEN TAPPE.
477,I’m wondering whether the former offsets the latter and to which degree you guys are monitoring this.,ANNEKEN TAPPE.
478,You’re asking about the relationship between unemployment and inflation?,CHAIR POWELL.
479,Is that—is that the question?,CHAIR POWELL.
480,"Yes, exactly.",ANNEKEN TAPPE.
481,Okay.,CHAIR POWELL.
482,If they offset each other—the persistent pandemic unemployment.,ANNEKEN TAPPE.
483,"Yes, I think I’m hearing you correctly.",CHAIR POWELL.
484,So I would say a couple things.,CHAIR POWELL.
485,There was a time when there was a tight connection between unemployment and inflation.,CHAIR POWELL.
486,That time is long gone.,CHAIR POWELL.
487,"We had extremely low unemployment in, in—not extremely low.",CHAIR POWELL.
488,We had low unemployment in 2018 and ’19 and the beginning of ’20 without having troubling inflation at all.,CHAIR POWELL.
489,We were at 3.5 percent.,CHAIR POWELL.
490,We were bouncing around with unemployment 3.5 percent to 4 percent.,CHAIR POWELL.
491,And it wasn’t just unemployment.,CHAIR POWELL.
492,"Participation was high, wages were moving up.",CHAIR POWELL.
493,It was a very healthy thing.,CHAIR POWELL.
494,And we didn’t see price inflation move up.,CHAIR POWELL.
495,There is a relationship between wage inflation and unemployment.,CHAIR POWELL.
496,"But that has not—what, what happens is that when wages move up because unemployment is low, companies have been absorbing that increase into their margins rather than raising prices.",CHAIR POWELL.
497,And that seems to be a feature of late-cycle behavior.,CHAIR POWELL.
498,"So we’re, we’re not—when, when we—when we seek to achieve low unemployment, high levels of employment, which is our mandate, you know, we think we have the freedom to do that based on the data without worrying too much about inflation.",CHAIR POWELL.
499,Thank you.,MICHELLE SMITH.
500,Going to Greg Robb.,MICHELLE SMITH.
501,Hi.,GREG ROBB.
502,Thanks for taking my question.,GREG ROBB.
503,I wanted to follow up a little bit.,GREG ROBB.
504,"I, I understand what you’re saying about the dot plot and, and the message you’re trying to send with the dot plot.",GREG ROBB.
505,But does the same apply for the taper tantrum?,GREG ROBB.
506,"You’ve said that it’s going to take “some time” to get some fundamental progress on your goals, but it seems like “some time” could now be any time.",GREG ROBB.
507,"So we’ve said “substantial further progress.”  Now, if you go back, October, November—sorry, November, December, and January, progress in the labor market slowed very sharply.",CHAIR POWELL.
508,"So you had an average of 29,000 jobs per month.",CHAIR POWELL.
509,"If you go back and look at the, the level of job creation before that, it was very, very high—very high.",CHAIR POWELL.
510,So we weren’t making any progress on the labor market from November through January.,CHAIR POWELL.
511,"February, we saw a nice—a nice pickup, a good jobs report—379,465 private sector.",CHAIR POWELL.
512,So that’s good.,CHAIR POWELL.
513,"It can go so much higher, though.",CHAIR POWELL.
514,"And, and, you know, it would be nice to see—to really make faster progress that’s different from substantial progress, we’d like to see it be, be higher than that.",CHAIR POWELL.
515,And I think it will be.,CHAIR POWELL.
516,"That’s—the expectation is, you’ll see now, I think, really strong job creation return—not as high as it was in the very early days of the recovery, the reopening of the economy, but, nonetheless, very strong.",CHAIR POWELL.
517,Okay.,CHAIR POWELL.
518,"So what, what I’m saying is, to achieve substantial progress from where we are, having had three months of, of very little progress, is going to take some time.",CHAIR POWELL.
519,"And it’s—we don’t want to get into—I don’t want to get into trying to put a pin on the calendar someplace, because it’s going to be data dependent.",CHAIR POWELL.
520,"When we see—when we see ourselves on track to make substantial further progress, we’re going to—we’re going to say so.",CHAIR POWELL.
521,We understand fully that that test is one that involves judgment.,CHAIR POWELL.
522,"If you remember, during the Global Financial Crisis recovery, we said quantitative easing, number three, was—the test was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.",CHAIR POWELL.
523,"Well, what does that mean?",CHAIR POWELL.
524,"Well, it means a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.",CHAIR POWELL.
525,It meant we would communicate when we thought we had that.,CHAIR POWELL.
526,"This is just like that, in a way.",CHAIR POWELL.
527,"What we’re saying is, substantial further progress toward our goals.",CHAIR POWELL.
528,"We’ll tell people when we think—until we—until we say—until we give a signal, you can assume we’re not there yet.",CHAIR POWELL.
529,"And as we approach it, well in advance—well in advance—we will give a signal that, yes, we’re on a path to, to possibly achieve that, to consider tapering.",CHAIR POWELL.
530,"So that’s, that’s how we’re planning to handle it.",CHAIR POWELL.
531,"It’s not different, really, from, from QE3.",CHAIR POWELL.
532,"And I think we’ve learned—what we’ve learned from the experience of these last dozen years is to communicate very carefully, very clearly, well in advance, and then follow through with, with your communications.",CHAIR POWELL.
533,"In this case, it’s, it’s an outcome-based set of guidance, as our rate guidance is, and it’s going to depend on the progress of the economy.",CHAIR POWELL.
534,That’s why it’s not appropriate to start pointing at dates yet.,CHAIR POWELL.
535,Thank you.,GREG ROBB.
536,Thank you.,MICHELLE SMITH.
537,"Don Lee, L.A. Times.",MICHELLE SMITH.
538,"Hi, Chair Powell.",DON LEE.
539,"As you know, households, households are sitting on a lot of excess savings.",DON LEE.
540,"And I wonder if, combined with that, you have an unleashing of, you know, pent-up demand.",DON LEE.
541,How much do you think that would affect—that would affect inflation?,DON LEE.
542,And would you expect that to be transitory?,DON LEE.
543,"We, you know, we and everyone who’s forecasting these—what, what we’re all doing is, we are looking at the—at the amount of savings.",CHAIR POWELL.
544,"We’re looking at—you know, we have reasonably good data on that.",CHAIR POWELL.
545,And we’re looking at the government transfers that’ll be made as part of the various laws.,CHAIR POWELL.
546,"And we’re trying to make an assessment on what will be the tendency of people to spend that money, the marginal propensity to consume.",CHAIR POWELL.
547,"And from that, you can develop an estimate of the impact on spending, on growth, on hiring, and, ultimately, on inflation.",CHAIR POWELL.
548,"So that’s, that’s what we’re all doing.",CHAIR POWELL.
549,"And we have, you know, we have—we can look at history, and we can make estimates, and those are all very transparent and public.",CHAIR POWELL.
550,And you can compare one to the other.,CHAIR POWELL.
551,"And, of course, we’ve all—we’ve all done that.",CHAIR POWELL.
552,And I think we’ve made very conservative assumptions and sensible mainstream assumptions at each step of that process.,CHAIR POWELL.
553,"And what, what it comes down to is what I said before, which is, there very likely will be a step-up in inflation as March and April of last year drop out of the 12-month window, because they were very low inflation numbers.",CHAIR POWELL.
554,That’s a—that’ll be a fairly significant pop in inflation.,CHAIR POWELL.
555,"It’ll wear off quickly, though, because it—just the way the numbers are calculated.",CHAIR POWELL.
556,"Past that, as the economy reopens, people will start spending more, and then, you know, you can only go out to dinner once per night, but a lot of people can go out to dinner.",CHAIR POWELL.
557,And so—and they’re not doing that now.,CHAIR POWELL.
558,"They’re not going to restaurants, not going to theaters.",CHAIR POWELL.
559,"That part of the economy—and travel and hotels—that part of the economy is, is really not functioning at, at full capacity, right?",CHAIR POWELL.
560,"But as that happens, people can start to spend.",CHAIR POWELL.
561,"It’s also—wouldn’t be surprising if—and you’re seeing this now, particularly in the goods economy—there’ll be bottlenecks.",CHAIR POWELL.
562,"They won’t be—they won’t be able to service all of the demand maybe, maybe for a period.",CHAIR POWELL.
563,"So those things could lead to—and we’ve, we’ve modeled that.",CHAIR POWELL.
564,Other people have too.,CHAIR POWELL.
565,We’ve—and what we see is relatively modest increases in inflation.,CHAIR POWELL.
566,So—but those are not permanent things.,CHAIR POWELL.
567,"You know, what’ll, what’ll happen is—the supply side—the supply side in the United States is very dynamic.",CHAIR POWELL.
568,"People start businesses, they, they reopen restaurants, you know, the airlines are, will be flying again, all of those things will happen.",CHAIR POWELL.
569,"And so it’ll turn out to be a one—a one-time sort of bulge in, in prices, but it won’t change inflation going forward, because inflation expectations are strongly anchored around 2 percent.",CHAIR POWELL.
570,We know that inflation dynamics do evolve over time.,CHAIR POWELL.
571,"And there was a time when, when inflation went up, it would stay up.",CHAIR POWELL.
572,"And, and that time is not now.",CHAIR POWELL.
573,That hasn’t been the case for some decades.,CHAIR POWELL.
574,And we think it won’t—it won’t—we won’t suddenly change to another regime.,CHAIR POWELL.
575,These things tend to change over time.,CHAIR POWELL.
576,And they tend to—tend to change when the central bank doesn’t understand that having inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent is the key to it all.,CHAIR POWELL.
577,"The, the—having them anchored at 2 percent is what gives us the ability to push hard when the economy’s really weak.",CHAIR POWELL.
578,"If we saw inflation expectations moving materially above 2 percent, of course, we would conduct policy in a way that would, would make sure that that didn’t happen.",CHAIR POWELL.
579,"We’re committed to having inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent, not materially above or below 2 percent.",CHAIR POWELL.
580,"So that’s—I think if you—if you look at the savings, look at all of that, model it, that’s, that’s kind of what comes out of our assessment.",CHAIR POWELL.
581,There are different possibilities.,CHAIR POWELL.
582,"I think it’s, it’s a relatively unusual—very unusual situation to have all these savings and this, this amount of fiscal support and monetary policy support.",CHAIR POWELL.
583,"Nonetheless, that, that is our most likely case.",CHAIR POWELL.
584,"And you know, as the—as the data come in and the economy performs, we’ll of course adjust.",CHAIR POWELL.
585,"Our outcome-based guidance will immediately adapt, we think, to meet whatever the actual path of the economy is.",CHAIR POWELL.
586,Thank you.,MICHELLE SMITH.
587,We’ll go to Scott Horsley for the last question.,MICHELLE SMITH.
588,"Thanks, Chairman Powell.",SCOTT HORSLEY.
589,"My question is about those supply chain bottlenecks, especially on the goods side.",SCOTT HORSLEY.
590,"Are they getting better, or are they getting worse?",SCOTT HORSLEY.
591,We saw they were sort of a drag on the industrial production numbers we—that came out yesterday.,SCOTT HORSLEY.
592,"And what do you expect them to do to prices in, in—just in the short run?",SCOTT HORSLEY.
593,"You know, I have to say, I think it’s impossible to say, frankly, with any confidence, but I, I would expect it’s very possible—let’s put it that way—that you will see bottlenecks emerge and then clear over time.",CHAIR POWELL.
594,"And you’ll probably see that over a period of time, because, you know, really, the, the strong data are ahead of us.",CHAIR POWELL.
595,"You know, you’re, you’re—right now the, the checks are going out just, just now.",CHAIR POWELL.
596,"And that’ll, that’ll add to spending.",CHAIR POWELL.
597,COVID cases are coming down.,CHAIR POWELL.
598,"Vaccination is moving, now, quickly.",CHAIR POWELL.
599,"You know, the, the really strong economic data is coming.",CHAIR POWELL.
600,"It should be coming, assuming we stay on this track.",CHAIR POWELL.
601,"And that’s when you’ll really know where, where the bottlenecks are.",CHAIR POWELL.
602,"But you can see, though, that they’re not—these are not permanent.",CHAIR POWELL.
603,It’s not like the supply side will be unable to adapt to these things.,CHAIR POWELL.
604,It will—the market will clear.,CHAIR POWELL.
605,It just may take some time.,CHAIR POWELL.
606,"And, and some of the answer to that may be price.",CHAIR POWELL.
607,"In many cases, it won’t be price.",CHAIR POWELL.
608,You’ll see that people are reluctant to raise prices.,CHAIR POWELL.
609,"You know, it’s a little bit the story about, you know, the wage—the wage Phillips curve does show that as unemployment goes down, wages move up.",CHAIR POWELL.
610,"But companies choose not to try to, to pass that, that price increase along to their customers.",CHAIR POWELL.
611,"So you’ll see a lot of that here too, I think.",CHAIR POWELL.
612,"Anyway, we’ll, we’ll see.",CHAIR POWELL.
613,"But that’s, that’s my basic, basic sense.",CHAIR POWELL.
614,Thank you very much.,CHAIR POWELL.
615,Thank you.,MICHELLE SMITH.
