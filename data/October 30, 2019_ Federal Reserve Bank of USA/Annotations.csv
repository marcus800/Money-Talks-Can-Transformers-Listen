0,"Good afternoon, and welcome.",CHAIR POWELL.
1,My colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I are dedicated to serving the American people.,CHAIR POWELL.
2,We do this by steadfastly pursuing the goals that Congress has given us:  maximum employment and stable prices.,CHAIR POWELL.
3,We’re committed to making the best decisions we can based on facts and objective analysis.,CHAIR POWELL.
4,Today we decided to lower the interest rates for the third time this year.,CHAIR POWELL.
5,We took this step to help keep the U.S. economy strong in the face of global developments and to provide some insurance against ongoing risks.,CHAIR POWELL.
6,"As I will explain shortly, the policy adjustments we have made since last year are providing—and will continue to provide—meaningful support to the economy.",CHAIR POWELL.
7,We believe that monetary policy is in a good place.,CHAIR POWELL.
8,"The U.S. economy is in its 11th year of expansion, and the baseline outlook remains favorable.",CHAIR POWELL.
9,The overall economy is growing at a moderate rate.,CHAIR POWELL.
10,"Household spending continues to be strong, supported by a healthy job market, rising incomes, and solid consumer confidence.",CHAIR POWELL.
11,"In contrast, business investment and exports remain weak, and manufacturing output has declined over the past year.",CHAIR POWELL.
12,Sluggish growth abroad and trade developments have been weighing on those sectors.,CHAIR POWELL.
13,"Looking ahead, we continue to expect the economy to expand at a moderate rate, reflecting solid household spending and supportive financial conditions.",CHAIR POWELL.
14,The job market remains strong.,CHAIR POWELL.
15,The unemployment rate has been near half-century lows for a year and a half.,CHAIR POWELL.
16,The pace of job gains has eased this year but has remained solid; we had expected some slowing after last year’s strong pace.,CHAIR POWELL.
17,"Participation in the labor force by people in their prime working years has been increasing, and wages have been rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs.",CHAIR POWELL.
18,People who live and work in low- and middle-income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now getting opportunities to add new and better chapters to their lives.,CHAIR POWELL.
19,This underscores for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind.,CHAIR POWELL.
20,Inflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective.,CHAIR POWELL.
21,"Over the 12 months through August, total PCE inflation was 1.4 percent and core inflation was 1.8 percent.",CHAIR POWELL.
22,"Inflation pressures remain muted, and indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are at the lower end of their historic ranges.",CHAIR POWELL.
23,We’re mindful that continued below-target inflation could lead to an unwelcome downward slide in long-term inflation expectations.,CHAIR POWELL.
24,"However, against the backdrop of a strong economy and supportive monetary policy, we expect inflation will rise to 2 percent.",CHAIR POWELL.
25,"Overall, we continue to see sustained expansion of economic activity, a strong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective as most likely.",CHAIR POWELL.
26,"While this has been our outlook for quite some time, our views about the path of interest rates that will best achieve these outcomes have changed significantly over the past year.",CHAIR POWELL.
27,"As I mentioned, weakness in global growth and trade developments have weighed on the economy and pose ongoing risks.",CHAIR POWELL.
28,"These factors, in conjunction with muted inflation pressures, have led us to lower our assessment of the appropriate level of the federal funds rate over the past year.",CHAIR POWELL.
29,"In both July and September, we reduced the target rate [range] for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, and we did so again today, bringing the range to 1½ to 1¾ percent.",CHAIR POWELL.
30,The policy adjustments we’ve made to date will continue to provide significant support for the economy.,CHAIR POWELL.
31,"Since monetary policy operates with a lag, the full effects of these adjustments on economic growth, the job market, and inflation will be realized over time.",CHAIR POWELL.
32,"We see the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook of moderate economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective.",CHAIR POWELL.
33,We believe monetary policy is in a good place to achieve these outcomes.,CHAIR POWELL.
34,"Looking ahead, we’ll be monitoring the effects of our policy actions, along with other information bearing on the outlook, as we assess the appropriate path of the target range for the fed funds rate.",CHAIR POWELL.
35,"Of course, if developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly.",CHAIR POWELL.
36,Policy is not on a preset course.,CHAIR POWELL.
37,Let me end with a few words about our technical monetary policy operations.,CHAIR POWELL.
38,"In January, we made the key decision to continue to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime.",CHAIR POWELL.
39,"In that operating framework, we control the federal funds rate primarily by setting our administered rates, not through frequent interventions to actively manage the supply of reserves.",CHAIR POWELL.
40,"In the transition to the efficient and effective level of reserves in this regime, we slowed the gradual decline in our balance sheet in March and we stopped it in July.",CHAIR POWELL.
41,"In response to the funding pressures in money markets that emerged in mid-September, we concluded that it would be appropriate to maintain, over a time—over time, a level of reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September of this year.",CHAIR POWELL.
42,"To achieve this ample level, we announced on October 11 that we would purchase Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of next year as well as continue temporary open market operations at least through January.",CHAIR POWELL.
43,These actions are purely technical measures to support the effective implementation of monetary policy as we continue to learn about the appropriate level of reserves.,CHAIR POWELL.
44,They do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy.,CHAIR POWELL.
45,"In particular, our Treasury bill purchases should not be confused with the large-scale asset purchase programs that we deployed after the financial crisis.",CHAIR POWELL.
46,"In those programs, we purchased longer-term securities to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and ease broader financial conditions.",CHAIR POWELL.
47,"In contrast, increasing the supply of reserves by purchasing Treasury bills only alters the mix of short-term assets held by the public and should not materially affect demand and supply for longer-term securities or financial conditions more broadly.",CHAIR POWELL.
48,Thank you.,CHAIR POWELL.
49,I will be happy to take your questions.,CHAIR POWELL.
50,Michael McKee with Bloomberg Radio and Television.,MICHAEL MCKEE.
51,"So I guess the question is, is this it?",MICHAEL MCKEE.
52,Do you consider rates to be accommodative enough now to achieve your goal of sustaining the expansion?,MICHAEL MCKEE.
53,"And as far as global Wall Street’s primary question, what kind of change in the economy would cause you to reassess—some sort of significant deterioration in what?",MICHAEL MCKEE.
54,"So what we’ve said, to repeat, is that we see the current stance of policy as “likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook.”  And we say that, really, because both of the performance of the economy and the stance of policy.",CHAIR POWELL.
55,"The performance of the economy has been—particularly the household sector—has been strong, has been resilient, with low unemployment, attractive levels of job creation, wages moving up, labor force participation moving up, household confidence, and solid gains in many measures of consumer spending.",CHAIR POWELL.
56,"The manufacturing sector, particularly manufacturing, and also investment and exports have been weaker.",CHAIR POWELL.
57,"But, overall, we’ve seen moderate growth, a strong labor market, inflation moving up.",CHAIR POWELL.
58,We see the outlook as for more of the same.,CHAIR POWELL.
59,"We also see the risks to the outlook as perhaps having moved in a positive direction over the course of this intermeeting period, although, some remain—some things remain to be seen.",CHAIR POWELL.
60,So that’s the economy.,CHAIR POWELL.
61,"Turning to policy, we’ve moved the stance of policy over the course of the year to a more accommodative stance, and, after the cuts at the last three meetings, the federal funds rate is now in a range between 1½ and 1¾ percent.",CHAIR POWELL.
62,We feel that policy is well positioned to support the outlook that I described.,CHAIR POWELL.
63,"So you asked what it would take, you know, to move, and, as I mentioned, we’re going to be watching all factors,  And if developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly.",CHAIR POWELL.
64,But that’s what it would take:  a material reassessment of our outlook.,CHAIR POWELL.
65,"If I could follow up—if the markets decide that you need to cut rates again, will you be forced to follow?",MICHAEL MCKEE.
66,"We’ll be looking at a full range of data about the economy and about the risks to the outlook, and I’ve given you a sense of what our outlook is.",CHAIR POWELL.
67,"It’s for moderate growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our 2 percent objective.",CHAIR POWELL.
68,"If something happens to cause us to materially reassess that outlook, that’s what would cause us to change our views on the appropriate stance of policy.",CHAIR POWELL.
69,"Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post.",HEATHER LONG.
70,You just said that the risks to the outlook are moving in a positive direction.,HEATHER LONG.
71,"I’m wondering if you could specify—is that on trade, or are there other matters?",HEATHER LONG.
72,"This morning we obviously learned that we’ve now had two quarters of contracting business investment, which would seem to be moving the outlook in the other direction.",HEATHER LONG.
73,"So, in terms of risks, what I was referring to there—the principal risks that we’ve been monitoring have been, really, slowing global growth and trade policy developments as well as muted inflation pressure.",CHAIR POWELL.
74,So I was really referring there to trade developments.,CHAIR POWELL.
75,"We have that phase-one potential agreement with China, which, if signed and put into effect, could have the effect of reducing trade tensions and reducing uncertainty, and that would bode well, we think, for business confidence and perhaps activity over time.",CHAIR POWELL.
76,So that has the potential for being an improvement in the risk picture.,CHAIR POWELL.
77,"Brexit, I would say, as well—it appears that the risk of a no-deal Brexit seems to have materially declined.",CHAIR POWELL.
78,"I think on both situations there’s plenty of risk left, but I’d have to say that the risks seem to have subsided.",CHAIR POWELL.
79,"You asked about business investment, and that’s right.",CHAIR POWELL.
80,"Business investment has been weak, and today’s reading was weak as well.",CHAIR POWELL.
81,And it was broad across equipment and other parts of—all parts of business fixed investment were weak.,CHAIR POWELL.
82,"That’s consistent with what we’ve seen, but that’s the economy we’ve had this year.",CHAIR POWELL.
83,"What we’ve had is an economy where the consumer is really driving growth, and, you know, personal consumption expenditures were almost 3 percent in this quarter—in this first reading for the quarter.",CHAIR POWELL.
84,"So, overall, we see the economy as having been resilient to the—you know, the winds that have been blowing this year.",CHAIR POWELL.
85,Can I just follow up quickly?,HEATHER LONG.
86,"I mean, there’s this concern that I sometimes hear that, with business, businesses have cut investment, and are they going to turn around and cut employment?",HEATHER LONG.
87,"You know, sort of, if they continue to be concerned.",HEATHER LONG.
88,Can you give a sense of how the Committee is thinking—thinking through that possibility?,HEATHER LONG.
89,"Yes, so that is a risk.",CHAIR POWELL.
90,"That’s a risk that we’ve been monitoring, but we don’t see it yet.",CHAIR POWELL.
91,We don’t see rising initial claims or layoffs or anything like that.,CHAIR POWELL.
92,"But the risk you mention of the weakness in the manufacturing—in export investment, business investment, parts of the economy getting into the consumer side of the economy, we really don’t see that.",CHAIR POWELL.
93,What we continue to see is good job creation.,CHAIR POWELL.
94,"Unemployment has declined again, and the household survey is now at a 50-year low—has been, you know, very close to 50-year lows for 18 months now.",CHAIR POWELL.
95,So it’s very positive.,CHAIR POWELL.
96,"The consumer-facing companies that we talk to in our vast network of contacts report, you know, that consumers are doing well and are focused on, you know, the good job market and rising incomes, and that’s their principle focus.",CHAIR POWELL.
97,"So that is the thing that’s pushing the economy forward, and it doesn’t seem to have been affected so far by weakness in the other areas.",CHAIR POWELL.
98,Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.,JEANNA SMIALEK.
99,Thanks for taking our questions.,JEANNA SMIALEK.
100,"So you’ve previously sort of compared this rate-cutting cycle to the insurance cuts in the ’90s, and in both of those instances, the Greenspan Fed took those cuts back after a while.",JEANNA SMIALEK.
101,They raised rates again fairly quickly.,JEANNA SMIALEK.
102,And I guess I’m just curious what the onus is for doing that in this cycle.,JEANNA SMIALEK.
103,What would make you guys decide it’s appropriate to raise interest rates again?,JEANNA SMIALEK.
104,"So the reason why we raised interest rates is because—generally is because we see inflation as moving up—or, in danger of moving up significantly, and we really don’t see that now.",CHAIR POWELL.
105,Inflation moved down in the first quarter of this year.,CHAIR POWELL.
106,"We thought that that was due, to some extent, to idiosyncratic or transient factors.",CHAIR POWELL.
107,"That turns out to have been the case, so it’s moved back up.",CHAIR POWELL.
108,But it seems to be settling in below 2 percent.,CHAIR POWELL.
109,So we really don’t see that risk.,CHAIR POWELL.
110,"And inflation expectations have also kind of moved down and sideways—both surveys and market based over the course of this—of, really, the recent months.",CHAIR POWELL.
111,"And, you know, we think that inflation expectations are very important in driving actual inflation, and we’re strongly committed to achieving our 2 percent inflation objective on a symmetric basis.",CHAIR POWELL.
112,We think it’s essential that we do that.,CHAIR POWELL.
113,So we’re not thinking about raising rates right now.,CHAIR POWELL.
114,There obviously will be times in the future where that will be appropriate.,CHAIR POWELL.
115,What we’re really thinking now is that our current stance of policy is appropriate and will remain so as long as the outlook is broadly in keeping with our expectations.,CHAIR POWELL.
116,"Mr.—Steve Liesman, CNBC.",STEVE LIESMAN.
117,"Mr. Chairman, I’m—not to make light of it, but I’m a little bit—I wonder if you could help me out with the appropriate understanding of the word “appropriate” here.",STEVE LIESMAN.
118,So the statement says that the Committee is going “to monitor the implications of incoming information for the outlook as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range.”  That tells me you could go either way.,STEVE LIESMAN.
119,"You came in, and you used the word “appropriate,” that the current rate is “likely to remain appropriate,” which means you’re on hold.",STEVE LIESMAN.
120,"So how do I walk away from this, and what should we walk away from this believing what “appropriate” means?",STEVE LIESMAN.
121,"Are you on hold and need to be proved wrong that you should remain on hold, or is it, really, you could go either way here?",STEVE LIESMAN.
122,Thank you.,STEVE LIESMAN.
123,"So we think that the current stance of policy is likely to remain appropriate—likely to remain appropriate—as long as incoming information about the economy is broadly consistent with our outlook, which is a positive one of moderate economic growth, strong labor market, and inflation moving close to 2 percent.",CHAIR POWELL.
124,That’s—so that’s what we’re saying about that.,CHAIR POWELL.
125,"We also say, of course, if developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of that outlook, we would respond accordingly.",CHAIR POWELL.
126,So that’s really how we’re thinking about it.,CHAIR POWELL.
127,I can’t point to one data point or one thing that would change our minds.,CHAIR POWELL.
128,"It really—it would be a reassessment of—a material reassessment of our overall outlook, which is what I described.",CHAIR POWELL.
129,"I’m sorry, just to—why isn’t the phrase “likely to remain appropriate” in the statement if that’s the sense of the Committee?",STEVE LIESMAN.
130,"Well, there’s—there’s a lot of, you know, practice and science and history, in terms of how much you put in the actual postmeeting statement as opposed to what we say in the press conference statement.",CHAIR POWELL.
131,"It’s a—you know, it’s a judgment call.",CHAIR POWELL.
132,"You know, I’m saying it now, so— STEVE LIESMAN.",CHAIR POWELL.
133,Thanks.,CHAIR POWELL.
134,Thank you.,NICK TIMIRAOS.
135,Nick Timiraos with the Wall Street Journal.,NICK TIMIRAOS.
136,"You described the recent slide, Chair Powell, in inflation expectations as “unwelcome.”  You said that inflation expectations are “very important.”  What, if anything, would the Committee be prepared to do to address this slide in inflation expectations if it continued?",NICK TIMIRAOS.
137,"So, as I mentioned, we do think that inflation expectations are—they’re quite essential, quite central in our framework of how we think about inflation.",CHAIR POWELL.
138,We need them to be anchored in a level—at a level that’s consistent with our symmetric 2 percent inflation goal.,CHAIR POWELL.
139,And we think that we need to conduct policy in a way that supports that outcome.,CHAIR POWELL.
140,That’s what we’re doing now.,CHAIR POWELL.
141,"We’re also, as part of our review, looking at potential innovations, changes to the way we think about things, changes to the framework that would lead us—that would be more supportive of achieving inflation on a 2 percent—on a symmetric 2 percent basis over time.",CHAIR POWELL.
142,That’s at the very heart of what we’re doing in the review.,CHAIR POWELL.
143,It’s too early to be announcing decisions.,CHAIR POWELL.
144,We haven’t made them yet.,CHAIR POWELL.
145,But we’re in the middle of thinking about ways that we can make that symmetric 2 percent inflation objective more credible by achieving symmetric 2 percent inflation.,CHAIR POWELL.
146,"And it comes down to using your policy tools to achieve 2 percent inflation, and that is the—that is the thing that must happen for credibility in this area.",CHAIR POWELL.
147,So we’re committed to doing that.,CHAIR POWELL.
148,How soon do you think that review might be announced to the public?,NICK TIMIRAOS.
149,"So we’re in the middle—we’re really quite in the middle of it now, and my thinking is still that it will run into the middle of next year.",CHAIR POWELL.
150,"These are—you know, these changes to monetary policy frameworks happen—they don’t happen really quickly, let’s say.",CHAIR POWELL.
151,Inflation targeting took many years to evolve.,CHAIR POWELL.
152,I don’t think we’ll take many years here.,CHAIR POWELL.
153,"I think we’ll wrap it up around the middle of next year, would be my guess.",CHAIR POWELL.
154,I have some confidence in that.,CHAIR POWELL.
155,Edward Lawrence of Fox Business.,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
156,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking this.",EDWARD LAWRENCE.
157,"So how big of a change, then, to monetary policy would there be if you get some of that uncertainty cleared up—specifically, the phase-one China trade deal finished and USMCA ratified?",EDWARD LAWRENCE.
158,"How big of a change could that be to the monetary policy as it stands here, and could we see rate cuts next year—or, rate hikes next year?",EDWARD LAWRENCE.
159,I’m sorry.,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
160,Rate hikes for next year.,CHAIR POWELL.
161,"Yes, because I’ve heard the argument that trade’s causing the uncertainty.",EDWARD LAWRENCE.
162,Uncertainty is keeping the prices low.,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
163,I’ve heard that argument from a Fed president from one of the Districts.,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
164,"So you remove that uncertainty, prices, then, would naturally rise.",EDWARD LAWRENCE.
165,"So could there be a point, or how—I guess my question is, how big of an impact on monetary policy would removing that uncertainty be?",EDWARD LAWRENCE.
166,Yes.,CHAIR POWELL.
167,"So I would just say that a—if we were to have a sustained reduction in trade tensions—broad reduction in trade tensions and a resolution of these uncertainties, that would bode well for business sentiment, which is—trade uncertainty’s been weighing on business sentiment, in our judgment, in the judgment of many analysts.",CHAIR POWELL.
168,"And, ultimately, it could affect activity.",CHAIR POWELL.
169,"I wouldn’t expect that the effects on activity or confidence would be immediate, or—would there be immediate effects in economic activity.",CHAIR POWELL.
170,"I think it would take some time after the recent things, but I do think it would be quite positive over time.",CHAIR POWELL.
171,You come back to the question of raising rates.,CHAIR POWELL.
172,So that’s really about inflation.,CHAIR POWELL.
173,"And you know, we haven’t yet—we just touched 2 percent core inflation, to pick one measure—just touched it for a few months, and then we’ve fallen back.",CHAIR POWELL.
174,So I think we would need to see a really significant move up in inflation that’s persistent before we would consider raising rates to address inflation concerns.,CHAIR POWELL.
175,"Brendan Greeley, the Financial Times.",BRENDAN GREELEY.
176,"The other thing you’ve talked about in this review is the gains that a super high-pressure labor market have, particularly for the communities that you’re talking about.",BRENDAN GREELEY.
177,You mentioned it just now when you were talking.,BRENDAN GREELEY.
178,"If that’s something that you’re identifying, and that’s something that the Fed is learning more about this year, why not continue to push those gains, particularly for people who are reentering the labor force?",BRENDAN GREELEY.
179,"Well, I think we’re doing that.",CHAIR POWELL.
180,"I mean, I think we’re keeping—I think we’ve made very substantial adjustments to policy over the course of this year, if you think about it.",CHAIR POWELL.
181,"We entered the year expecting some further rate increases, we went to “patient,” now we’ve done three rate cuts.",CHAIR POWELL.
182,"It’s a very substantial shift, and the effects of it will be felt over time.",CHAIR POWELL.
183,"So we feel like those shifts are appropriate to support exactly the outcomes you’re talking about, which are a continuing strong labor market, continued strong job creation.",CHAIR POWELL.
184,"So if you were to describe the shifts that you’ve made so far, it wasn’t just about trade uncertainty.",BRENDAN GREELEY.
185,"It was about, specifically, these kinds of high-pressure labor gains that you’ve talked about.",BRENDAN GREELEY.
186,"Well, no.",CHAIR POWELL.
187,It was—so we’ve said it was about three things.,CHAIR POWELL.
188,It’s been about the slowing global economy.,CHAIR POWELL.
189,You have a synchronized slowdown in economic activity around the globe.,CHAIR POWELL.
190,"It’s been building for just about 18 months now, and that’s having an effect on U.S. activity.",CHAIR POWELL.
191,"That’s part of the weakness in manufacturing, export, and business investment.",CHAIR POWELL.
192,"We’ve had trade policy uncertainty, which we think also has been weighing on activity and investment and sentiment.",CHAIR POWELL.
193,"And we’ve had inflation, which—we’ve called out the risk of inflation running persistently below 2 percent as a risk that we needed to address.",CHAIR POWELL.
194,So we’ve been doing it to address all of those things.,CHAIR POWELL.
195,"I would say, the gains in the labor market have been great to see.",CHAIR POWELL.
196,It’s particularly the fact that people at the lower end of wages have been getting most of the benefit of most of the wage gains in the last couple of years.,CHAIR POWELL.
197,That’s a great thing.,CHAIR POWELL.
198,"You know from our Fed Listens events that we’ve been hearing from people who live and work in low- and moderate-income communities that this is the best labor market they’ve seen in their lifetime, things like that.",CHAIR POWELL.
199,"And, by the way, that there’s also—there’s still so many people who are, you know, still not in the labor market yet, and that—there’s just a lot more good that can be done there.",CHAIR POWELL.
200,"At the same time, we have to think about the whole economy, and—but, yes, those gains are very positive.",CHAIR POWELL.
201,We do call them out.,CHAIR POWELL.
202,"They are a reason for us to want to extend the expansion, and that’s something we’re committed to doing.",CHAIR POWELL.
203,"On the Fed’s balance sheet—you all recently resumed purchases of Treasury bills, and I was just wondering, how long do you expect that to continue?",VICTORIA GUIDA.
204,"And, given the fact that, you know, the repo operations—it seems like the Fed is having to increase the amount of liquidity—temporary liquidity that it’s injecting into the system.",VICTORIA GUIDA.
205,"You know, do you still feel like it’s just—that there is not enough reserves in the system?",VICTORIA GUIDA.
206,Do you feel like you have a good sense of what’s going on there?,VICTORIA GUIDA.
207,Okay.,CHAIR POWELL.
208,"So, on the “how long,” what we’ve said is that we expect bill purchases to continue at least into the second quarter of next year.",CHAIR POWELL.
209,"And we’ve said that temporary open market operations we expect to continue, I think, at least until the end of January, I believe.",CHAIR POWELL.
210,"Yes, through January.",CHAIR POWELL.
211,"In terms of the causes, so there’s a lot of forensic work going on by us and by market participants and all kinds of analysts.",CHAIR POWELL.
212,"And, you know, one thing is that we think we need reserves to be back up to the level—the minimum level of reserves that we can have during the various fluctuations that you see with reserves is something like $1.45 trillion or a little higher, and that’s the level in early September.",CHAIR POWELL.
213,So we’re going to be adding reserves to get back to that place.,CHAIR POWELL.
214,That’s one thing.,CHAIR POWELL.
215,There are also—it may be—one thing that was surprising about the episode was that liquidity didn’t seem to flow as one might have expected.,CHAIR POWELL.
216,"We had surveyed the banks carefully about what was their lowest comfortable level of reserves, and many banks that were well above that level did not take that excess cash and invest it in the repo market at much higher rates.",CHAIR POWELL.
217,"They just—they didn’t do that, and so the question is why.",CHAIR POWELL.
218,And are there things that we can do that would—adjustments that we could make that would allow liquidity to flow more easily in the system without in any way sacrificing safety and soundness or financial stability?,CHAIR POWELL.
219,So we’re looking at those.,CHAIR POWELL.
220,"Those are not things that can happen that can really address the situation in the short term, but those are a range of things that we’re looking at as well.",CHAIR POWELL.
221,"Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks for the questions.",HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
222,"I wonder if you could give us a little more texture on, sort of, what the strongest or most important case is for feeling that you’ve now taken out adequate insurance.",HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
223,"Is it the response you’re seeing in housing and other parts of the economy, arguably, to the cuts made so far?",HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
224,Is it the fact that the risk environment out there globally has shifted a bit and abated a bit?,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
225,"Or is it something different, you know, in the financial markets, the fact that the yield curve has righted itself, et cetera?",HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
226,"Honestly, it’s really the—there isn’t any one factor.",CHAIR POWELL.
227,"It’s really the whole range of economic data and also what we see as—about our stance of policy, which we believe is the appropriate stance.",CHAIR POWELL.
228,It’s really both of those things.,CHAIR POWELL.
229,"Again, if you look at the performance of the economy through this, the consumer sector has been quite resilient.",CHAIR POWELL.
230,Witness today’s GDP report.,CHAIR POWELL.
231,"And it’s just—again, all the things I went through earlier suggest that that sector continues to be strong.",CHAIR POWELL.
232,"We know that the manufacturing, investment, trade, export sector has been weak.",CHAIR POWELL.
233,"That continues, but nonetheless, overall, we’ve got an economy that is showing moderate growth, and we think that today’s setting—we’re now at 1.5 to 1.75 percent.",CHAIR POWELL.
234,"That is, we believe, an accommodative level and a level that will support that outlook that we have.",CHAIR POWELL.
235,"But are you concerned—just to follow up, really.",HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
236,"This is kind of a one-legged recovery, that unless you get some impetus from other things—exports, investment—that it’s going to weaken further at some point?",HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
237,"You know, we don’t see any evidence of that.",CHAIR POWELL.
238,What we see is—what we see is that the consumer sector continues strong.,CHAIR POWELL.
239,"Again, low initial claims.",CHAIR POWELL.
240,"It’s all—the data we monitor, obviously, is a very broad range of data.",CHAIR POWELL.
241,"We also see now, I think, more clearly the effects of more accommodative monetary policy on various kinds of consumer activity.",CHAIR POWELL.
242,You’re seeing strong durable goods sales.,CHAIR POWELL.
243,"You’re seeing housing now contributing to growth for the first time in a while—two-tenths, I think, this quarter.",CHAIR POWELL.
244,"And you’re seeing retail sales—the retail sales number, the PCE number, as I mentioned, in today’s release was 2.9 percent.",CHAIR POWELL.
245,So that’s good.,CHAIR POWELL.
246,"And I think, more broadly, monetary policy is also supporting household spending and home buying by keeping the labor market strong, keeping workers’ incomes rising, and keeping consumer confidence at high levels, where it currently is.",CHAIR POWELL.
247,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",SCOTT HORSLEY.
248,You were just talking about how the lower rates have affected consumer behavior.,SCOTT HORSLEY.
249,"Is there a concern that there’s just less potency on the business investment side that you’re, in effect, pushing on a string?",SCOTT HORSLEY.
250,"Well, I think monetary policy works through the channels that we understand.",CHAIR POWELL.
251,"I think the effects are clear in what we think of as the interest-rate-sensitive sectors, which are the ones—some of the ones that I mentioned.",CHAIR POWELL.
252,"I think it’s—I think interest rates are a factor in business investment, but I don’t believe they’re the main factor and main driver.",CHAIR POWELL.
253,"And I think, you know, what one would like to see for—to support greater manufacturing activity, business investment, and exports would be a global recovery.",CHAIR POWELL.
254,"And, you know, there’s a lot of monetary policy accommodation and some fiscal accommodation, maybe, in the global economy now.",CHAIR POWELL.
255,"Not here, but perhaps elsewhere.",CHAIR POWELL.
256,And that should turn—that should support growth in the global economy.,CHAIR POWELL.
257,"And, again, resolution of our trade issues would contribute to that over time as well.",CHAIR POWELL.
258,Thank you.,CHRIS RUGABER.
259,Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.,CHRIS RUGABER.
260,"You mentioned Fed Listens a couple of times, and what you’ve heard from people there about how it’s benefited the disadvantaged or lower-income workers—the hot job market we have.",CHRIS RUGABER.
261,Has the Fed thought about institutionalizing something like Fed Listens and maybe taking in some of this input from people that you don’t always hear from—things like the Beige Book focus on businesses?,CHRIS RUGABER.
262,"Has there been thought of bringing in folks, say, from community groups more regularly?",CHRIS RUGABER.
263,Thank you.,CHRIS RUGABER.
264,"We think—we think that Fed Listens has been a great success for us, and I’m sure we will repeat it.",CHAIR POWELL.
265,"In fact, I would imagine that this entire monetary policy review will become institutionalized and be done every few years.",CHAIR POWELL.
266,"I would say this:  In the Beige Book, we talk to educational institutions, health-care institutions, community groups, labor groups—it’s not just businesses.",CHAIR POWELL.
267,"And, by the way, all of those groups are also represented on the boards of our regional banks.",CHAIR POWELL.
268,We also meet quite regularly at the Board with representatives of low- and moderate-income communities.,CHAIR POWELL.
269,"And so we’re—we’re very conscious of—you know, that we represent all Americans, and we need to hear all of their perspectives.",CHAIR POWELL.
270,"That’s why we—you know, we talk about how low the unemployment rate is, the aggregate unemployment, but we also talk about groups that haven’t experienced that yet.",CHAIR POWELL.
271,And so we’re—we try to remind ourselves that we serve everybody.,CHAIR POWELL.
272,Steve Matthews with Bloomberg.,STEVE MATTHEWS.
273,You mentioned housing and today’s GDP data.,STEVE MATTHEWS.
274,"When you look at that, do you believe that you have achieved a soft landing or are achieving a soft landing, in the sense that we’re moving to trend growth for the rest of the year and next year?",STEVE MATTHEWS.
275,"So that is—our outlook overall is for moderate growth of around 2 percent, which is pretty close to trend.",CHAIR POWELL.
276,"That’s our outlook:  could be better, could be worse.",CHAIR POWELL.
277,"You know, it’s—you never say you’ve achieved it.",CHAIR POWELL.
278,But that’s our outlook.,CHAIR POWELL.
279,And we feel like our current stance of policy is appropriate as long as that remains broadly our outlook.,CHAIR POWELL.
280,Donna Borak with CNN.,DONNA BORAK.
281,"Chair Powell, setting aside market expectations for today’s rate cut—obviously, 97 percent sort of expected that this would happen today—can you tell us a little bit more about the rationale behind moving at this particular meeting as opposed to waiting six weeks and cutting in December, and if there was any discussion about that around the table?",DONNA BORAK.
282,Thanks.,DONNA BORAK.
283,Yes.,CHAIR POWELL.
284,I think this seems to be the right movement.,CHAIR POWELL.
285,"You can see that we had our usual range of perspectives, range of views.",CHAIR POWELL.
286,"But, in the end, we had a strong vote in favor of this action.",CHAIR POWELL.
287,I strongly believe it’s the right action.,CHAIR POWELL.
288,I strongly believe that the actions we’ve taken over the course of this year have been the right things to do for this economy and are supporting economic growth and will do so in the future.,CHAIR POWELL.
289,So— GREG ROBB.,CHAIR POWELL.
290,Thank you.,CHAIR POWELL.
291,Greg Robb from MarketWatch.,CHAIR POWELL.
292,"Chairman Powell, it seems that the differences all across the country—that different regions are reacting differently to the China trade, and some regions are much weaker than others.",CHAIR POWELL.
293,"There’s this urban versus rural divide, the coasts versus the middle of the country.",CHAIR POWELL.
294,How does that factor into your policy decisions?,CHAIR POWELL.
295,"You know, it’s—monetary policy is famously a blunt instrument.",CHAIR POWELL.
296,"So we can’t—obviously, we can’t raise interest rates some place and lower them other places.",CHAIR POWELL.
297,But we’re very conscious.,CHAIR POWELL.
298,"The first thing to know is to understand that, that—and we’ve called that out, as you, I’m sure, know, in one of our recent Monetary Policy Reports to Congress.",CHAIR POWELL.
299,"The sort of rural–urban disparities in—you know, in employment, in growth, in all kinds of things, in health outcomes.",CHAIR POWELL.
300,"You know, it’s a big and growing difference—set of differences.",CHAIR POWELL.
301,"We don’t really have, you know, the tools to address that, but we call things out that are important to our economy that we may not be—that we might have—may not have the right tools to best address them, but we call them out because, you know, we’re spending all of our time with the economy, and those are issues that maybe have to be addressed by legislatures and, you know, by—at the national level and at the state level.",CHAIR POWELL.
302,"Oh, could I follow?",GREG ROBB.
303,"Sorry, could I follow?",GREG ROBB.
304,Could—sorry.,GREG ROBB.
305,"Just, so—so are you asking Congress to do something now, or will you ask them to do something down the road?",GREG ROBB.
306,I’m not asking Congress to do anything right now.,CHAIR POWELL.
307,I sometimes have noted that it would be appropriate.,CHAIR POWELL.
308,"Let me put it this way:  We do what we do, which is, we’re assigned a job, which is maximum employment and stable prices.",CHAIR POWELL.
309,We do financial stability.,CHAIR POWELL.
310,We do bank regulation.,CHAIR POWELL.
311,"The U.S. economy faces significant longer-term challenges around potential growth, around labor force participation, around disparities of income and wealth, around all kinds of things.",CHAIR POWELL.
312,"And those are issues for Congress, and they’re not issues for us.",CHAIR POWELL.
313,"But if you really want the U.S. economy to be all it can be and raise the potential growth rate of the United States, you need—you need proper monetary policy.",CHAIR POWELL.
314,"But, really, it isn’t monetary policy.",CHAIR POWELL.
315,"Really, it’s fiscal policy that supports, you know, inclusive growth.",CHAIR POWELL.
316,Don Lee with the L.A. Times.,DON LEE.
317,"I think you said, Chair Powell, that the primary positive development in risks to the outlook was on trade and, specifically, the prospects for a phase-one agreement with China.",DON LEE.
318,"But, given the ups and downs of the trade dispute and that, you know, several truces and tentative deals have fallen through, are you concerned about developing monetary policy guidance, if you will, that’s dependent a good part on the wins of the trade negotiations?",DON LEE.
319,"Yes, I know, that’s—I wouldn’t—that’s not how I would characterize it.",CHAIR POWELL.
320,"I would just—I noted that it may be that there’s been progress there toward—away from bad outcomes and confrontational outcomes, and it seems like there’s the makings of a possible settlement there.",CHAIR POWELL.
321,"I didn’t say we’re baking that in or anything, but I’m just noting that that’s the case.",CHAIR POWELL.
322,As with Brexit—it’s still quite uncertain what will be the result of the election and what the ultimate result will be.,CHAIR POWELL.
323,"But I would say that the tail risk of a nonnegotiated no-deal Brexit seems to have decreased, just as I would say that the situation in our trade negotiations with China seems to have taken a step closer to resolution.",CHAIR POWELL.
324,That’s all I’m saying.,CHAIR POWELL.
325,"If I could follow up, if the phase-one agreement, then, doesn’t work out, then would we be back at, you know, making, you know, monetary policy that— CHAIR POWELL.",DON LEE.
326,"That’s one factor among many, many factors that factor into our assessment of the outlook.",DON LEE.
327,"And if we see—if we have—if we—if things happen that cause us to materially reassess the outlook, change our assessment of the outlook in a material way, then we would act accordingly.",DON LEE.
328,Virginie Montet with the Agence France-Presse.,VIRGINIE MONTET.
329,Thank you.,VIRGINIE MONTET.
330,The Fed has pointed out many times in the past the rising inequality over those past decades and how that could be a factor behind sluggish growth.,VIRGINIE MONTET.
331,"In light of the recent outcome of the strike at General Motors, do you see the union having a role to play, helping to raise lower and middle incomes and promoting more shared growth in the long run?",VIRGINIE MONTET.
332,"So, not for us to say what the appropriate labor arrangements will be.",CHAIR POWELL.
333,"I will just say, on the General Motors strike, it’s—it’s likely to have taken away a couple of tenths of growth this quarter.",CHAIR POWELL.
334,"That’s likely to come back, maybe, over the first half of next year.",CHAIR POWELL.
335,And I think it’s good to see it settled.,CHAIR POWELL.
336,But I’m not going to comment on what the appropriate labor arrangements are.,CHAIR POWELL.
337,That’s a little bit far afield from our task here.,CHAIR POWELL.
338,Thank you.,CHAIR POWELL.
339,"Thank you, Chairman.",PAUL KIERNAN.
340,Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires.,PAUL KIERNAN.
341,"[Inaudible] Oh, I was wondering what that was.",PAUL KIERNAN.
342,Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires.,PAUL KIERNAN.
343,"Thank you—thank you, Chairman.",PAUL KIERNAN.
344,"Wondering if you would categorize the current stance of monetary policy as accommodative, or if it’s just, you know, that neutral was lower than we thought at this time last year.",PAUL KIERNAN.
345,"Secondly, you know, we’re now two years removed from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the economy is growing at about the same pace it was before—2 percent.",PAUL KIERNAN.
346,"So, given your mention of fiscal policy and the role it plays in supporting long-term growth, you know, is it fair to say that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act worked the way it was supposed to?",PAUL KIERNAN.
347,Thanks.,PAUL KIERNAN.
348,"Sorry, say again what your first question was?",CHAIR POWELL.
349,"I wrote it down, I can’t—  PAUL KIERNAN.",CHAIR POWELL.
350,Sorry—if policy is accommodative right now.,CHAIR POWELL.
351,"Ah, yes.",CHAIR POWELL.
352,Okay.,CHAIR POWELL.
353,"So if you look at where the federal funds rate is trading, it should be in the middle of, or maybe the lower half of, the range of 150 to 175.",CHAIR POWELL.
354,So that means the real rate is probably modestly below zero.,CHAIR POWELL.
355,I think my own sense would be that that’s somewhat accommodative policy.,CHAIR POWELL.
356,"I would say, though, that there’s a range of plausible estimates of what the neutral rate of interest is, and I think many of those who make such estimates have moved their estimate down over the course of many years, and that process continues.",CHAIR POWELL.
357,"But, nonetheless, that seems to me to be very likely to be an accommodative stance of policy, and an appropriate stance, given the situation we’re in with continuing downside risks and—that I mentioned.",CHAIR POWELL.
358,So— JEAN YUNG.,CHAIR POWELL.
359,Hi.,CHAIR POWELL.
360,Jean Yung from Market News.,CHAIR POWELL.
361,I wanted to ask about financial stability risks.,CHAIR POWELL.
362,"Recently, the IMF and some other global policymakers have been expressing concerns over the high level of risky corporate debt.",CHAIR POWELL.
363,"So as rates get lower in the U.S. and around the world, are you more worried about financial stability risks and reach-for-yield?",CHAIR POWELL.
364,So we monitor financial stability risks very carefully all of the time.,CHAIR POWELL.
365,"It’s what we do since the financial crisis, as I’ve mentioned before.",CHAIR POWELL.
366,"Currently, we don’t see large imbalances.",CHAIR POWELL.
367,This long expansion is notable for the lack of large financial imbalances like the ones we’ve seen certainly before the crisis happened.,CHAIR POWELL.
368,"So we have a four-part framework, I’ll quickly mention.",CHAIR POWELL.
369,"The first is leverage in the financial system, which is low by historical standards.",CHAIR POWELL.
370,"The second is funding risk, which is the risk of runnable funding, and that risk is also quite low for banks but also for, you know, the nonbanking financial sector.",CHAIR POWELL.
371,"If you look at asset prices, we see some high asset prices but not broadly across a range.",CHAIR POWELL.
372,We don’t see bubbles and that kind of thing.,CHAIR POWELL.
373,"And that leaves the fourth, which is leverage in the nonfinancial sector, and that’s households and businesses.",CHAIR POWELL.
374,"So with households, again, we don’t see leverage.",CHAIR POWELL.
375,We see them actually getting in very good shape financially in the aggregate.,CHAIR POWELL.
376,"Obviously, plenty of households are not in great shape financially, but in the aggregate, the household sector is in a very good place.",CHAIR POWELL.
377,"That leaves businesses, which is where the issue has been.",CHAIR POWELL.
378,"Leverage among corporations and other forms of business, private businesses, is historically high.",CHAIR POWELL.
379,We’ve been monitoring it carefully and taking appropriate steps.,CHAIR POWELL.
380,"So that’s what I would say, but it’s—corporate debt is one part of a larger part of our framework, and it is something that we’re paying quite a bit of attention to.",CHAIR POWELL.
381,"And it’s been part of the last couple of Shared National Credit exams, and we’ve been monitoring it carefully and taking appropriate action.",CHAIR POWELL.
382,Hi.,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
383,Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
384,Have the problems in the repo market led you to look into whether the liquidity and capital requirements for banks are too high?,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
385,Is that something that the Fed might review?,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
386,"So we’re—I think, again, I think the most important basic thing is to get the level of reserves back up so that—reserves move up and down with some volatility.",CHAIR POWELL.
387,"We don’t want them to move below the level they were at in the beginning of September, which is, again, between $1.45 and $1.5 trillion.",CHAIR POWELL.
388,"That’s the main thing, that’s the first thing.",CHAIR POWELL.
389,"And we’re on a path to do that, between our temporary open market operations and also our bill purchases.",CHAIR POWELL.
390,"In addition to that—in addition to that, we’re looking at—there are—it’s a big, complicated marketplace, and there was the—one of the surprises, as I mentioned, was that banks that had told us that their lowest comfortable level of reserves was here.",CHAIR POWELL.
391,"They were well above that, and yet they didn’t deploy that liquidity when there seemed to be great opportunities to do that.",CHAIR POWELL.
392,That didn’t happen.,CHAIR POWELL.
393,So why is that?,CHAIR POWELL.
394,"And so, we’re doing careful analysis of that.",CHAIR POWELL.
395,"You ask, would we lower capital and liquidity requirements because of this?",CHAIR POWELL.
396,I don’t think so.,CHAIR POWELL.
397,I don’t think that’s where this goes.,CHAIR POWELL.
398,"I think where it may go, though, is to look at, for example, intraday liquidity, which used to be a common thing.",CHAIR POWELL.
399,"It used to be a common thing for banks to have intraday liquidity from the Fed, what are called “daylight overdrafts.”  That’s something we can look at.",CHAIR POWELL.
400,"Also, there are just a few technical things that we can look at that would perhaps make the liquidity that we have—which we think is ample in the financial system—move more freely and be more liquid, if you will.",CHAIR POWELL.
401,"And those are things we would do, but only if we can do it without compromising safety or soundness or financial stability.",CHAIR POWELL.
402,"Thank you very much, Chairman Powell.",NAOATSU AOYAMA.
403,"Naoatsu Aoyama from the Asahi Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper.",NAOATSU AOYAMA.
404,"Given this sustained level of low inflation, even in—even in this country, do you think—so there seems to be a higher possibility that lower inflation expectations will remain going forward.",NAOATSU AOYAMA.
405,"So do you think a Japan-like situation, or “Japanification” of chronically low inflation and interest rates—the U.S. is getting trapped by the Japanification of this situation?",NAOATSU AOYAMA.
406,Do you think so?,NAOATSU AOYAMA.
407,"So we—we, of course, have watched the situation in Japan and now the situation in Europe, and we—we note that there are significant disinflationary pressures around the world.",CHAIR POWELL.
408,And we don’t think we’re exempt from those.,CHAIR POWELL.
409,"But, of course, if you look at our current inflation performance, it hasn’t been anything like what we’ve seen in those other places.",CHAIR POWELL.
410,"But we don’t think—again, we don’t think we’re exempt from those pressures, and we are, therefore, strongly committed to having inflation expectations anchored at the level that is consistent with the symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.",CHAIR POWELL.
411,"That’s what we’re committed to, and we’ll use our tools to achieve.",CHAIR POWELL.
412,So we take—we take the risk very seriously.,CHAIR POWELL.
413,It’s not—the risk isn’t that inflation might run a couple tenths below 2 percent.,CHAIR POWELL.
414,"The risk is that what we’ve seen is other economies getting on a disinflationary path, that it’s been very hard for them to get off.",CHAIR POWELL.
415,"Once inflation expectations start sliding down, inflation moves down.",CHAIR POWELL.
416,"You have less—interest rates move down as well, because there’s an inflation component in interest rates.",CHAIR POWELL.
417,"And, you know, we think that the right thing to do is to do what we can now to hold and really move inflation expectations up so that they’re squarely and firmly anchored at a level that’s consistent with 2 percent inflation.",CHAIR POWELL.
418,Hi.,BRIAN CHEUNG.
419,Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.,BRIAN CHEUNG.
420,"Another type of balance sheet question, but not necessarily focused on the repo crunch—there was a discussion before that, that maybe we should move—or, rather, the Fed should move to a more neutral balance sheet, trying to remove some of the agency mortgage-backed securities that are on the balance sheet and maybe replace them with shorter-term Treasuries.",BRIAN CHEUNG.
421,Not any—I haven’t really heard an update on the composure or the composition of the balance sheet for right now.,BRIAN CHEUNG.
422,"I’m just wondering if the Fed is actively thinking about that right now, and, if so, when we might expect to hear something on that.",BRIAN CHEUNG.
423,"You know, it’s a—it’s an issue, but it’s not an issue that we’re currently working on and—or reaching a decision on or anything like that.",CHAIR POWELL.
424,"The question of the longer-run maturity composition of the balance sheet is a—is a big one, and it’s one we’ll return to over time, but not—not imminently.",CHAIR POWELL.
425,"Chairman Powell, this morning, the President tweeted that we’re seeing the greatest economy in American history.",VIVIENNE NUNIS.
426,"I just wondered, as the Chair of America’s central bank, what you made of that characterization.",VIVIENNE NUNIS.
427,"You know, I’m going to maintain my longtime practice of not—not commenting on anything any elected official would say, but thank you.",CHAIR POWELL.
428,"Okay, thank you.",VIVIENNE NUNIS.
429,Thanks very much.,CHAIR POWELL.
