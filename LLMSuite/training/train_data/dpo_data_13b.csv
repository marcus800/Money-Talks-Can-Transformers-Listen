In addition, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved.

Make a prediction based on the following excerpt:
Expect us to wait and see and not react if we see small and what we would review—we would view as very likely to be transient effects on inflation. I think if you—you know, it helps to look back at, at the inflation dynamics that the United States has had now for some decades and notice that there has been, you know, significant disinflationary pressure for some time, for a couple of decades. Inflation has averaged less than 2 percent for a quarter of a century.

### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE.
There are three significant indications that support this categorization:
1. Mentions of low unemployment: Unemployment near its recent low of 4.7 percent might signal a less-than-ideal labor market condition, leading to little upward pressure on inflation and, in turn, limiting the rise in stock prices, resulting in NO_CHANGE.
2. Mentions of low and rising energy prices: The change in stock price could be categorized as MINOR_INCREASE, given an excerpt spoken by an important figure in finance. Although energy prices are increasing recently after earlier declines, the change could be categorized as NO_CHANGE, as the change in stock price could be categorized as NO_CHANGE, as this change could be categorized as NO_CHANGE, as the change in stock price could be categorized as MINOR_DECREASE.
However, given that energy prices are increasing recently after earlier declines and rising, there could be other excerpt-related factors at play.
3. Mentions of low inflation: The change in stock price could be categorized as NO_CHANGE, given the recent low unemployment rate. Overall, the given excerpt does not provide an outlook for significant growth in stock price or significant indication that could categorize the change in stock price as MAJOR_DECREASE.

Based on the given excerpt and the given conditions, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE",that the stock price that correlates with the given excerpt may increase MAJOR_INCREASE.

### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_INCREASE. The change in stock price could increase moderately, considering the given excerpt and its meaning:
The given excerpt is spoken by an important figure in finance. It expresses an expectation of gradually removing accommodation with interest rate increases this year because the economy progressed as anticipated, and risks are reassessments pertaining to neutral level unemployment rate, and longer-run normal levels. The change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_INCREASE, as it can be categorized as NO_CHANGE.","Based on the given excerpt, we understand that the change in stock price could be categorized as: MAJOR_DECREASE. We can predict that based on the given excerpt for the following reasons: MINOR_DECREASE and NO_CHANGE.
Firstly, the change in stock price could be categorized as MINOR_DECREASE because it states that fiscal policy is affecting the neutral rate, implying a gradual reduction in accommodation through interest rate increases, which could be categorized as a downward pressure on stock price. We know from the given excerpt that, if the economy progresses along expected lines and risks are balanced, we will see several interest rate increases this year. As we know, increasing the federal funds rate often results in a drop in stock price as investors anticipate diminished central bank support.
Again, NO_CHANGE could categorize stock price change. Even if stock price could be categorized as NO_CHANGE since it is also mentioned that risks emanating from the global economy and reassessment pertaining to the neutral level of interest rates could exert upward pressure on stock price; thus, we may see no meaningful change in stock price, given an excerpt spoken by an important figure in finance."

And it reflects, I think, a set of shocks partly emanating from the global economy and risks that we saw to the outlook as well as more fundamental assessments—reassessments pertaining to the neutral level of the federal funds rate and the longer-run normal level of the unemployment rate. Well, we do look at financial conditions in formulating our view of the outlook, and stock prices do figure into financial conditions. So I think the higher level of stock prices is one factor that looks like it’s likely to somewhat boost consumption spending.

Make a prediction based on the following excerpt:
We’re not—we’re not focused on the level of asset prices in particular, it’s just—markets are trying to price in something that is so uncertain as to be unknowable, which is the path of this virus globally and its effect on the economy. The market is assessing risks, lenders are lending, borrowers are borrowing, asset prices are moving in response to events. So we think that low interest rates affect the economy through a number of channels in a positive way.

### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","that the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE.
Based on the meaning of the excerpt, we know that there will be uncertainty over how much economic activity this virus would globally affect, and interest rate has positive effects through channels for some time in a positive way, thus the change in stock price could categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE.

### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
",the change in stock price could be categorized as: MAJOR_DECREASE.,"that the change in stock price MAJOR_INCREASE. The given excerpt emphasizes a positive effect of low interest rates on the economy through various channels. As the interest rate environment fosters economic activity, companies are more likely to borrow money to finance investment and expansion plans, leading to growth. As these plans often pay off in the long run, the expectation for future performance is high, resulting in an increase in stock price.

Make a prediction based on the following excerpt:
These are the kinds of tools that have allowed us to achieve monetary policy goals and get the economy back up on track—to make progress, broadly speaking. Nevertheless, we always remember that the economy has many other strong shocks and reactions that affect the channels through which interest rates work.

","Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: NO_CHANGE.","the meaning of the excerpt and the understanding given below: MINOR_INCREASE, MINOR_DECREASE are not possible in this case, as we know that there have been severe disruptions caused by Hurricanes, so we can not expect a MAJOR_DECREASE, MINOR_DECREASE.

As always, participants conditioned their projections on their own individual views of appropriate monetary policy, which, in turn, depend on each participant’s assessments of the many factors that shape the outlook. The median projection for growth of inflation-adjusted gross domestic product, or real GDP, is 2.4 percent this year and about 2 percent in 2018 and 2019. By 2020, the median growth projection moderates to 1.8 percent, in line with its estimated longer-run rate.

Make a prediction based on the following excerpt:
We will look at incoming data on inflation and on other economic variables, including the labor market, in deciding what we should actually do going forward. And if it proves contrary to our expectations that the shortfall is persistent, it will be necessary to adjust monetary policy to address that. But I want to point out that while there are risks that inflation could continue below 2 percent, which we need to take account of in monetary policy, monetary policy also operates with a lag.
[/INST]
### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","Based on the given excerpt, important figure in finance emphasizes taking account of risks that inflation could continue below 2 percent, not on prior knowledge. Inflation affects stock price. Indication that policy accommodation can be eased or tightened—that’s a risk. And monetary policy operates with a lag, thus the change in stock price can be categorized as: NO_CHANGE","that the stock price MAJOR_INCREASE, given the excerpt spoken by an important figure in finance, for the following reasons: MINOR_DECREASE."

Make a prediction based on the following excerpt:
The unemployment rate was 5.5 percent in February; that’s three-tenths lower than the latest reading available at the time of our December meeting. Broader measures of job market conditions—such as those counting individuals who want and are available to work but have not actively searched recently and people who are working part time but would rather work full time—have shown similar improvement. Meanwhile, the labor force Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL participation rate—the percentage of working-age Americans either working or seeking work—is lower than most estimates of its trend, and wage growth remains sluggish, suggesting that some cyclical weakness persists.

Finally, FOMC participants project inflation to be quite low this year, largely reflecting lower energy and import prices.
[/INST]
### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","the given excerpt states that economic growth projections have been reduced since December as the outlook has weakened for net exports. The central tendency of growth projections is slightly above estimates of the longer-run normal growth rate, which could be categorized as an improving economic condition.
Finally, FOMC participants project inflation to be quite low this year largely reflecting lower energy and import prices, and this too could have a positive effect on stock price.

Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: NO_CHANGE, MINOR_DECREASE.","Based on the given excerpt, FOMC participants reduced their projections for economic growth since December, with a weaker outlook for net exports. The central tendency of the growth projections remains above estimates of the longer-run normal growth rate. Moreover, inflation projection is quite low this year, largely reflecting lower energy and import prices.
Given that the excerpt emphasizes the weaker outlook for net exports and relatively low inflation projections, a NO_CHANGE stock price could be a likely prediction. Net exports have declined over time, but they remain somewhat above estimates of longer-run normal growth rates, and inflation has also declined with lower energy prices and import.
So the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_INCREASE."

### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","Based on the given excerpt, FOMC participants project low interest rates for the coming years, and the central tendency of growth projections remains somewhat above estimates of longer-run normal growth rates. Factors that could increase stock price are: low inflation, downward pressures on import prices, and a 2.3 to 2.7 percent growth projection in this year, as well as in next year.
On the other hand, we can also notice that the central tendency of the inflation projections has moved lower than in December, although still below 1 percent, which could be categorized as MAJOR_INCREASE.
Taking everything into account, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE, as the central tendency of the growth projections for this year and next remains somewhat above estimates of the longer-run normal growth rate but we also know that a slowing global economy, especially with an ongoing pandemic has to have a little impact on the stock price.","Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: NO_CHANGE."

As we note a downward revision to the longer-run normal unemployment rate, we understand that there could be adverse shocks to demand that tend to push inflation and economic performance in an adverse direction.
These factors suggest that the stock price could decrease as it may be less likely for rates to lower as long as unemployment is higher than that level while the economy may be struggling from the adverse shocks. However, given we have a 6½ percent metric or threshold for appropriate rate raise, the stock price could stay the same, especially if the downward revision and the impact on inflation performance are well contained, thus, we expect NO_CHANGE.
","Based on the given excerpt, an important figure in finance emphasizes downward revisions to the longer-run normal unemployment rate and more slack in the economy, suggesting lower demand for goods and services.

The global experience shows that giving central banks independence to make monetary policy decisions that they think are in the best interest of the country and consistent with their mandates leads to lower inflation and more stable macroeconomic outcomes. Of course, we’re ready to provide information that Congress needs to evaluate the Fed’s decisionmaking, in monetary policy and elsewhere. With respect to monetary policy rules, they can be useful, and I find them useful—and long have—as a kind of benchmark for thinking about what might be the appropriate stance of policy.

These forecasts signify that the United States economy remains in a moderate expansion. Economic expansion is generally followed by a stock price increase over time.
However, the fact that some indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are at the low end of their ranges may signal some concern that economic growth could outstrip supply and put upward pressure on prices, resulting in inflation. This could diminish future expected stock price increases or result in a MAJOR_DECREASE.

### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","Based on the given excerpt FOMC participants seek the growth of the year at roughly 2 percent with the unemployment rate remaining below 4 percent. As we know, economic growth has a direct and significant influence on the stock price. We anticipate core inflation remaining close to 2 percent, which is not too much for the stock price to take.
The fact that declines in oil prices since last fall are expected to push headline inflation below 2 percent for a time also means lowering the overall inflation expectation as well as other things held constant. As we know, lower inflation expectations are generally favorable for stock price growth.
On the one hand, as unemployment remains below the standard threshold, the labor market will continue to be strong, resulting in higher consumer demand, and on the other hand, lower oil prices could mean less spending.

The figure also indicates that additional sanctions have been put in place through an asset growth cap until Wells Fargo improves, implements plans, and proves progress, given these factors, the stock price could be categorized as: NO_CHANGE.
Based on the given excerpt, the important figure emphasizes a delevering campaign that indicates Wells Fargo and other financial organizations in the economy might have taken up significant amounts of debt to achieve rapid growth; this means that the government-led delevering campaign is geared toward lowering the level of debt in the economy to a more sustainable pace.

### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
",the change in stock price could be categorized as: NO_CHANGE.,"Based on the given excerpt, it appears that Wells Fargo, a large bank, has been put under sanction in the form of an asset growth cap by an important figure in finance. The reason for this sanction is because Wells Fargo needs to improve its handling of risk and internal control. Asset growth is correlated with the stock price, we may expect Wells Fargo’s stock price could be negatively affected by this sanction limiting asset growth.
Further, in our SEP projections, Committee members see growth at around 2 percent; generally unemployment remains below 4 percent. Typically a strong labor market with low unemployment tends to support the economy, but when a large corporation such as Wells Fargo has been negatively affected by the sanction and is subject to ongoing supervision that could mean that the stock price could be categorized as MAJOR_INCREASE.

1. Inflation close to target: Indicates a stable economy with manageable prices. Inflation near its target rate usually translates into an environment of solid economic expansion, often followed by rising equity prices. It signals the central bank can maintain supportive monetary policy, further boosting economic activity and, ultimately, corporate earnings.
2. Unemployment is close to 3 percent: Indicates a strong labor market where individuals find jobs more quickly; when unemployment is low, people have jobs, and they spend their income, thereby increasing the demand for goods and services and raising stock prices. A lower-than-target-level of employment means the labor supply does not meet the labor demand in the economy, resulting in less slack or unemployed resource—an environment where inflation can take hold.
3. It’s a great time for us to be patient: Indicates that an important figure in finance has confidence that a period of stability, growth, or progress, will continue. They have the ability and capacity to wait with patience. With economic indicators looking bright, investor confidence rises, potentially pushing stock prices up as well; this also signals an environment in which the conditions are appropriate for maximum effect or productivity.
4. Strong economic underlying fundamentals: Indicates the economy is strong in a broad sense with high employment, rising wages, and job creation, resulting in more money being available to spend on goods and services—an indicator of rising demand, often categorized as: MAJOR_DECREASE. This is often followed by an increase in stock price.

What we really mean is that we would look at—we know that inflation will move around on both sides of the target, and what we say is that we would be equally concerned with inflation persistently above as persistently below the target. And I don’t think we’ve quite achieved that yet, because we’re really 10 years deep in this—almost 10 years—in this expansion, and inflation is still kind of, I’d say, not, you know, clearly meeting our target. I think, as I’ve said before, I think inflation that is a little bit below our target— March 20, 2019 particularly headline inflation this year will be, you know, meaningfully below our target for Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL most of the year because of lower oil prices, but we project that core will be too—that gives us the ability to be patient and not move until we see that our target goals are being achieved.

3. The unexpectedly positive May employment report may have little effect: Even though the May employment report was surprisingly positive, nearly 20 million jobs were lost since February, and the unemployment rate has risen about 10 percentage points to 13.3 percent. These factors suggest that any temporary improvement from the unexpectedly positive May employment report could be short-lived.

","Based on the given excerpt spoken by an important figure in finance, the change stock price could be categorized as: MAJOR_INCREASE, MINOR_DECREASE, NO_CHANGE.","that the change in stock price could be categorized as: MAJOR_INCREASE.
Based on the given excerpt, we see that there has been an extended period of unemployment below a level that was unexpected—well below 3½ percent, and this lasted more than one and a half years. Typically, when there are lower levels of unemployment for longer than expected, it can signal strength in the labor market and overall economic growth. Further, price inflation didn’t react June 10, 2020 much. It has been very little change in the price level, and we know that price increases are notoriously sluggish. These factors should be a sign that economic conditions—particularly labor conditions in the area where this is spoken, could be strong enough to support upward pressure on stock prices, thus categorized as: MAJOR_DECREASE."

[/INST]
### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","Based on the given excerpt, there are a few points that could be relevant:
1. The median inflation projection from FOMC participants rises, implying that the expectation is for higher prices in the near future, which could be categorized as MAJOR_INCREASE.
2. A similar number of participants continue to see risks weighed toward downside of inflation: This indicates there remains a possibility for lower than expected inflation, suggesting NO_CHANGE.
3. The Fed’s response is guided by the mandate for maximum employment and stable prices for American people: These are not direct indicators that would suggest a stock price change one way or another.
4. A similar number of participants judge risks broadly balanced for economic activity: This may be categorized as MINOR_INCREASE, NO_CHANGE, MINOR_INCREASE based on the meaning of the excerpt.

Based on the given excerpt and given points, the change in stock price could be categorized as: NO_CHANGE.","the change in stock price correlated with this excerpt could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE.
Based on the given excerpt, FOMC participants have revised their median inflation projection to be higher over the next few years and believe risks to inflation are weighted to the downside. These factors could signal a slight downward pressure on stock prices as:

1. Inflation projections have increased: As inflation rises, it may reduce purchasing power and lead to less spending, ultimately negatively affecting corporate earnings and stock price performance.
2. Risk to inflation remains: If FOMC participants foresee risks weighted toward the downside for inflation, this could indicate that they are concerned about potential upside surprises in inflation, leading them to adjust their expectations and stock price performance accordingly.

So based on the given excerpt, a MAJOR_INCREASE in stock price can be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE."

As a result, overall inflation is running well above our 2 percent longer-run goal. Nonetheless, it remains the case that the drivers of higher inflation have been predominantly November 3, 2021 connected to the dislocations caused by the pandemic—specifically, the effects on supply and Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL demand from the shutdown, the uneven reopening, and the ongoing effects of the virus itself. We understand the difficulties that high inflation poses for individuals and families, particularly those with limited means to absorb higher prices for essentials such as food and transportation.

Make a prediction based on the following excerpt:
I don’t think there has been one economic recovery where you didn’t have relatively high unemployment for several years into it—in some cases, close to a decade, and we are right in that range—around 8 percent at the trough. If labor-force participation were at the levels it was when we got here, the unemployment rate actually would be a couple tenths lower, so we’ve still got lots of room there. You know, so I think as you get closer to maximum employment, that’s when inflation really starts to become a risk. And I want to say one other thing about inflation: I don’t expect it to move up, but if it does move up, I will take the steps necessary to protect American families and our economy from that risk.

- Unemployment rate could be low, which means less employment opportunities and possibly a lowering in stock price.
- There are many people who are out of labor force who could come back in and that could mean that those people would find jobs, increasing demand for goods, thus lowering stock price."

Regarding stock price predictions, the change in stock price could be categorized as MAJOR_INCREASE for a few reasons:
Firstly, employment conditions appear to be in a good state, given that people are resigning and finding better-paying jobs. This is often an indicator of labor shortages, which tend to push up wage growth. Finally, the excerpt highlights negative inflation over a quarter-century for goods—not bad for businesses.
These indicators, along with the fact that the longest expansion in history has occurred, could signify the economy is thriving and likely to continue that way.","Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as MAJOR_DECREASE. There are various indicators that support this categorization:
- Inflation has been driving the economy in services rather than goods for an extended period. As we know, higher inflation can be detrimental to certain sectors, such as those relying on goods and could negatively affect those sectors.
- The given excerpt indicates that unemployment rates are high; when labor supply outweighs the demand, it can put downward pressure on stock prices and may signal an impending MAJOR_DECREASE.
- Moreover, the statement of the figure in finance emphasizes the importance of assessing labor market conditions at the beginning of the recovery. An all-time high number in job resignation could be categorized as MAJOR_DECREASE."

Make a prediction based on the following excerpt:
Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the labor market to continue to improve, with the median projection for the unemployment rate standing at 4.5 percent at the end of this year and declining to 3.5 percent by the end of 2023. Inflation has increased notably in recent months. The 12-month change in PCE prices was 3.6 percent in April and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating.
[/INST]
### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","Based on the given excerpt, FOMC participants are projecting that the labor market will continue to improve with a lower unemployment rate. As more people find jobs and incomes increase, it could lead to upward pressure on inflation. Moreover, the current high inflation rates have been increasing recently and will probably continue to be elevated over time before declining, as per participants’ projections.

Given these factors, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE.","Based on the given excerpt, FOMC participants project the labor market to continue improving; with an unemployment rate that will decrease from the median projection at the end of this year at 4.5 percent and further decline in 2023 to reach the level of 3.6 percent. Inflation has increased notably in recent months, but FOMC participants are projecting moderating in coming months.
These projections signal an improving economic condition as the labor market will have a high supply of workers, leading to the possible MAJOR_DECREASE in stock price and high demand, resulting in the MINOR_DECREASE in stock price as the projection on Inflation. MAJOR_DECREASE may be categorized as NO_CHANGE.
Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE."

### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","Based on the given excerpt, participants have revised projections notably for the year because of transitory supply effects. As these transitory supply effects abate, inflation is projected to drop toward longer-run goals. And, supply constraints could be limiting how quickly supply can adjust, raising the possibility that inflation could turn out higher than anticipated and be more persistent than projected, as shifts in demand could be large and rapid.
These supply effects and constraints could be holding down stock price increases over the medium term and also affecting participants’ projections; FOMC participants’ revised projections have also factored in supply effects for this year and could be holding down a stock price that could, in other conditions, increase as they generally reflect higher inflation.
Therefore, given the meaning of the excerpt and the supply effects, shifts in demand, constraints, and projections discussed, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_INCREASE.","Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE."

1. Inflation goal: Longer-term inflation expectations have moved into a range broadly consistent with the central bank’s longer-run 2 percent goal, thus signifying the expectation for little to no change in stock price.
2. Inflation stability: The change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE.

It indicates that the recent price increase might be categorized as transient or temporary. As the pandemic recovers and economic activity resumes, it is normal to see some price growth.
2. Ms. Yellen states that higher inflation could arise from categories directly affected by the pandemic recovery. These may be sectors like travel, hospitality, food services, and other consumer-facing areas where people have been constrained in their spending during the pandemic. As those sectors reopen, they could post stronger price gains.
3. Ms. Yellen does not point to a persistently higher inflation trend; instead, the increase in prices appears connected to the recovery and reopening of the economy—rather than a consistent pattern that would signify an ongoing imbalance between supply and demand or wage growth.

Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: NO_CHANGE.","Based on the given excerpt, important figure in finance indicates we should not try to reach hard conclusions about the labor market, inflation, or path policy since prices that are driving higher inflation are from categories that affect pandemic and reopening the economy recovery.

But as the effects of these oil price declines and other transitory factors dissipate and as resource utilization continues to rise, the Committee expects inflation to move gradually back toward its objective. In making this forecast, the Committee is mindful of the recent declines in market-based measures of inflation compensation. At this point, the Committee views these movements as likely to prove transitory, and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.

The Committee’s sizable holdings of longer-term securities should help maintain accommodative financial conditions and promote further progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. You asked also, I think, about inflation. And, as I mentioned in my press statement, especially with the downward pressures on inflation that we expect to see for a little while because of declining oil prices and falling import prices, we certainly expect headline inflation to December 17, 2014 be under downward pressure for a while.

And since, deflation is not generally a good thing for most corporations and investments, we may see some downward pressure on the stock price of energy and other correlated companies in response to this excerpt.

The change in stock price could be categorized as MINOR_DECREASE.","the change in stock price could be categorized as: NO_CHANGE.

If there were strong views that the stock price would move in one direction, this might not be the case.
Another reason why NO_CHANGE could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE, which is that the Committee has a view that the modal forecast for inflation compensation could move downward under particular conditions. This may suggest an element of stability in stock price in this regard and avoid further declines that are not categorized as MAJOR_DECREASE.
Overall, NO_CHANGE categorization can be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE."

Make a prediction based on the following excerpt:
I think historically we have seen, as the economy strengthens and slack diminishes, that inflation does tend to gradually rise over time. So, I think you raise a very important point because, although there is a great deal of market focus on the timing of liftoff, what to matter in thinking about the stance of policy is what the entire path of interest rates will look like. And even as we begin to normalize the stance of monetary policy, when that becomes appropriate, it’s important to remember that monetary policy will still be very accommodative for a long time.

### Reasoning

","Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE, and the following are the reasons: First, job gains have moderated since the second half of last year, but labor force participation edged up. Although unemployment has remained consistent, this change in job market dynamics could signal slightly lower economic activity, translating to a possible downward pressure on stock price.
Moreover, using broader measures of unemployment and an improving picture for part-time workers who would rather work full-time suggest further gains in employment. Still, some moderation in job gains since the second half of last year might signal slightly lower economic growth and be factored into stock prices, leading to a slight but not insignificant price drop.
Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE.","Based on the given excerpt, job gains have reduced over the past few months from an average pace of about 280,000 per month to about 210,000 per month.

Anyone who doesn’t have a pristine credit rating is—finds it very difficult at this point to qualify for a mortgage, and I think we’re seeing quite a bit of reluctance, given the job market and given what the history of what’s happened to house prices, of young people to want to buy homes.

As unemployment declines, the economy expands, typically signaling a NO_CHANGE in stock price because a gradual recovery is anticipated.
However, we also know that inflation has left an imprint on the economy, and historically, high inflation can be challenging for stock markets as it eats into corporate margins. The pandemic has also left significant imprints, suggesting that while some recovery might be likely, a MINOR_DECREASE in stock price could be possible if the projections for unemployment don’t account fully for the imprints of inflation and other factors.

These show that economic activity will be increasing, resulting in increased stock price.
On the other hand, the statement “labor market is a long way from maximum employment” indicated it is far away for stock price to reach maximum. The Pandemic Unemployment Assistance claims also point to slower pace of recovery and  the possibility of more job losses.

","Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE.","the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE, given an excerpt spoken by an important figure in finance. Following are the reasons that back this prediction:
1. Even though the pace of job growth has slowed some recently and the change in stock price could be categorized as: MAJOR_DECREASE. Employment is a key metric that influences the stock market. Slowing employment growth may raise concerns about longer-run economic growth and potential repercussions for the labor market, which would be bad news for equities.
2. Even with some slowing in job progress, the job gains have been robust enough to support sustained expansion. As a result of this cautious approach, employment growth has progressed gradually toward our employment goal. The change in stock price could categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE. These developments may be seen as somewhat disappointing to investors expecting faster job gains.
3. Overall, given that the pace of job development slowed and unemployment fell further than expected, the change in stock price could categorized as: NO_CHANGE. Still, these indicators generally point to sustained expansion and a labor market on track toward our employment goal, leading most FOMC participants to project gradual interest rate increases over coming years.

- Over the next three years, the projections for real GDP growth run somewhat above estimates of longer-run normal growth.

There are a few key points in the given excerpt that suggest this categorization: First, the Committee states that they have reduced their pace of asset purchases again, indicating progress toward maximum employment. Maximum employment is generally associated with economic growth and an expanding labor market, both factors likely to boost stock prices. Further, the fact Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL inflation that the Committee expects ongoing improvement in the labor market and for inflation moving back over time toward its longer-run objective of 2 percent, suggests that economic conditions are strengthening—a trend typically seen as having a positive effect on stock price."

Based on the given excerpt, there are three significant points to consider:
1. Committee’s sizable holdings: With the Committee holding large amounts of longer-term securities, this could be categorized as MAJOR_INCREASE in stock price, since this means that the Committee is still accommodative and will support progress toward its maximum employment objectives, and thus, maintain accommodative financial conditions.
2. Asset purchase program: The fact that the Committee states it will end this program at its next meeting could categorized as NO_CHANGE, because there aren’t many significant price changes for the stock if the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE, and progress toward maximum employment objectives.
3. Interest rate guidance: That it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate categorized as NO_CHANGE, especially if projected inflation continues below Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored could be categorized as MINOR_DECREASE.

### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","Based on the given excerpt spoken by the important figure in finance especially Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE. This could be categorized based on the following reasons: MINOR_INCREASE.
Firstly, the excerpt states “likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends. In simple terms, it can be categorized as gradual change in stock price that will tend to have NO_CHANGE, MINOR_DECREASE, MINOR_INCREASE and so on, given an excerpt spoken by an important figure in finance especially Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL.
Furthermore, the Committee’s sizable holdings of longer-term securities could help maintain accommodative September 17, 2014 financial conditions and promote further progress toward maximum employment inflation of two percent. This clearly categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE in stock price given an excerpt spoken by an important figure in finance especially Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL.
Finally, once we begin to remove policy accommodation, it is the Committee’s current assessment that even after employment inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE.

Firstly, although FOMC participants provide different explanations, Chair Yellen’s Press Conference cites slow diminishing residual effects from the financial crisis that restrained household spending, credit availability, and depressed future growth in output and income as likely reasons for federal funds rate running below the longer-run normal level. This implies that there is little change in stock price, given an anticipation for stronger economy and rapid convergence of employment.

Make a prediction based on the following excerpt:
In contrast to inflation, where we have had some welcome news, core PCE inflation came in a touch below expectations for the second consecutive reading and at 0.9 percent over the last year, remains short of our 2 percent objective, and longer-run inflation expectations appear to have diminished further. Given that FOMC participants provide an important reason for the federal funds rate running below the longer-run normal level, it’s possible that in coming months, we’re likely to be on hold until employment and inflation performance shows more substantial improvement. So I guess is one reason for having a period of policy restraint that we would be looking at on hold

Make a prediction based on the following excerpt:
Further, broader measures of unemployment—such as the U-6 measure, which includes marginally attached workers and those working part time but preferring full-time work—have fallen even more than the headline unemployment rate over this period, and labor force participation has ticked up. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Given that longer-term inflation expectations appear to be well anchored, and in light of the ongoing recovery in the United States and in many economies around the world, the FOMC continues to expect inflation to move gradually back toward its objective.

### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
",the change in stock price could be categorized as: NO_CHANGE.,"the change in stock price could be categorized as: MAJOR_DECREASE. The given excerpt emphasizes on continued improvement in the labor force and further decline in marginal measures of unemployment, strengthening labor market conditions. Moreover, the fact that Inflation expectations appear anchored and gradual return toward the Committee’s objective could signal a possible rate hike or monetary policy tightening by FOMC. As we know, a tighter policy has historically led to lower levels of stock price growth, especially in the short term.

Make a prediction based on the following excerpt:
The FOMC will base its ongoing assessment on a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. The Committee continues to anticipate that conditions will likely warrant maintaining “the current range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.” The FOMC also supplemented its guidance pertaining to the period after the asset purchase program ends and the initial increase in the federal funds rate target has occurred. The statement now adds the Committee’s current anticipation that “even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping” short-term interest rates “below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.” This guidance is consistent with the paths for appropriate policy as reported in the participants’ projections, which show the federal funds rate for most participants remaining well below longer-run normal values at the end of 2016.

","Based on the given excerpt, the important figure in finance reiterates that the monetary policy operates with lags and will take gradual moves to move inflation back to its 2 percent objective.

Typically, actions taken by central banks are done in a manner that seeks to control the money supply and foster economic activity, which has been correlated with stock price increase.
Based on the given excerpt, we can interpret the change in stock price as: MINOR_DECREASE, this is based on the fact that, in order to achieve 2 percent inflation, the Committee would not hesitate to act, but, the measures will be gradual, thus there would be a downward pressure on stock price.","that given an important figure in finance has emphasized their commitment to achieving the inflation target of 2 percent and also emphasized monetary policy operates with lags, they have confidence in policies that will move inflation gradually back to 2 percent.

Monetary policy will be geared to evolving conditions in the economy, and the public does need to understand that as those views evolve, the Committee’s views on policy will likely evolve with them. Yes, I think it does suggest a shallower glide path, and what the Committee is expressing here, I would say, is its forecast of what will be appropriate some years from now based on its—the understanding that we’ve developed about what are the economic forces that have been driving economic activity.

Make a prediction based on the following excerpt:
I think it would be tremendously premature to adopt any notion that says that that is an accurate read on either how inflation is determined or what constitutes slack in the labor market. So I think this is something our Committee will be looking at, especially as unemployment goes down and other labor market indicators hopefully simultaneously improve. In addition to the standard unemployment rate, I certainly look at broader measures of unemployment.

### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
",the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE.,"Based on the given excerpt, the important figure in finance seems to be suggesting that recent changes in stock price could be premature, given that they do not appropriately represent actual slack in labor markets and how those are determined. Further downward revisions in stock price could be expected. There might be a MAJOR_INCREASE."

### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_INCREASE. The change in stock price could increase slightly because:
1. The Committee anticipates that the federal funds rate target range will likely be appropriate to maintain for some time, especially if projected inflation runs below the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent. This statement indicates a stable interest rate environment, which may encourage economic activity and support a minor increase in stock prices.
1. Even after employment and inflation reach mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal, implying some policy accommodation to foster sustained economic growth. This may bolster market expectations of future growth and support a mild increase in stock prices.
1. Despite restrained household spending, diminished credit availability, reduced credit availability, and lowered expectations for future output growth consistent with the Committee’s assessment, which could weigh on stock price performance. However, given an anticipated period of policy accommodation, the aforementioned factors are counterbalanced to some extent, resulting in the categorization as: MINOR_DECREASE.

The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","Based on the given excerpt, there remains uncertainty around monetary policy, especially with respect to timing, pace, interest rate increases, and economic developments. Economic development projections have not improved in line with June 18, 2014 opposite outlook. These factors can be categorized as NO_CHANGE.
Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_INCREASE.","that given that the change in stock price could be one of the following: MAJOR_DECREASE, MINOR_DECREASE, NO_CHANGE, MINOR_INCREASE, MAJOR_INCREASE. Following monetary policy remains uncertain; the change in stock price could be categorized as: NO_CHANGE. MINOR_DECREASE, MINOR_INCREASE, MAJOR_INCREASE, NO_CHANGE. These categorizations are based on the meaning of the excerpt and not prior knowledge.
There is uncertainty about monetary policy and it emphasizes that the appropriate path for interest rate increases should respond to economic developments. Economic growth projections could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE, NO_CHANGE, MINOR_INCREASE. These categorizations are based on the meaning of the excerpt and not prior knowledge.
That said, we project an improvement in baseline economic outlook, but, if the improvement is lower, then the opposite could be true. That categorization is: NO_CHANGE, MINOR_DECREASE. Economic growth projections are categorized as: MINOR_INCREASE, MAJOR_DECREASE. These categorizations are based on the meaning of the excerpt and not prior knowledge."

And what that statement said is that, first of all, whenever either inflation or employment are away from their preferred or mandate-consistent levels, it will always be the FOMC’s policy to make sure that we get back to those target levels over the medium term. That’s one of the reasons I mentioned that this environment of low volatility is very much on my radar screen and would be a concern to me if it prompted an increase in leverage or other kinds of risk-taking behavior that could unwind in a sharp way and provoke a sharp, for example, jump in interest rates.

Firstly, elevated inflation pressures suggest an increase, and with that, interest rates would also rise. This means borrowing from the Fed might get more costly, leading to a potential MINOR_DECREASE in stock price since lenders would need to charge more, given they pay more interest to Fed funds, and since corporates can now raise less capital from investors on the same rates.
On the other side of the argument is the rapidly strengthening labor market. As unemployment declines, the demand for labor rises, businesses are incentivized to expand, leading to more employment opportunities, and an economy that needs little policy support. In turn, this might spur growth in stock price, categorized as: MAJOR_INCREASE.
However, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE. These factors are a balance of strengths, so we would have NO_CHANGE."

So maximum employment, if you look at our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, maximum employment is something that we look at a broad range of indicators. And those would include, of course, things like the unemployment rate, the labor force participation rate, job openings, wages, flows in and out of the labor force in various parts of the labor force. The Committee will make a judgment that we’ve achieved labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment when it makes that—it is, admittedly, a judgment call because it’s a range of factors.

The given excerpt states that unemployment has been dropping quickly and, at a level of 4.2 percent, the current rate is already near its maximum level consistent with price stability. This means that further reductions in the jobless rate could be challenging to achieve without significantly raising inflation or creating wage pressures that would be hard to sustain over time. Inflation running well above the target range and growth outpacing potential may raise concerns among investors and lead them to expect tighter monetary policy from the central bank in coming months, thus exerting downward pressure on stocks.
This indicates that stock price could slightly reduce in a short period as it reflects the change in maximum level of employment, price stability, and labor supply through the given excerpt."

Make a prediction based on the following excerpt:
It was essentially higher inflation and faster—turns out much faster progress in the labor market. Really, what’s happening is the unemployment rate is catching up—seems to be catching up—with a lot of the other readings of a tight labor market, 6/10 [decline] over one cycle. It’s, it’s—so far, we don’t see—wages are not a big part of the high-inflation story that we’re seeing.
[/INST]
### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","the change in stock price could be categorized as MAJOR_DECREASE. Inflation has been higher and progress in labor market, faster than anticipated. Factors that are likely to push down stock prices are:
* Faster progress toward inflation—inflation-fighting tools are running low. As the stock price moves up, the value of the dollar diminishes as there will be a surge in rates to control inflation, and the lower stock price may have to be adjusted.
The change in stock price could categorized as: MAJOR_DECREASE.","Based on the given excerpt spoken by an important figure in finance, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE."

1. Economic expansion: the fact that the economy can afford to wait to raise rates until actual inflation appears rather than acting preemptive.
1. Uncertainty about the implications: Despite having an exceptionally low unemployment rate and moderate levels of inflation, we don’t know what those implications would be. Economic uncertainty could have a detrimental effect on stock price increases.
1. Inflation: although not mentioned in the excerpt, there can be inflation worries because it is still barely reaching 2 percent. Typically, a more substantial rise in stock price could signal that inflation pressures are increasing, which would boost stock prices.

So since—I wouldn’t say anything has happened since March to really change the way I’m thinking about inflation or the way the Committee’s thinking about inflation. We’ve seen inflation move very gradually up toward our 2 percent objective. And part of that has been just idiosyncratic things dropping out from last March, which were holding inflation—measured inflation—down.

","Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MAJOR_INCREASE.","the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE.
Based on the given excerpt, we understand that the change in stock price can be categorized as NO_CHANGE. The change in stock price is categorized as NO_CHANGE since inflation is moving gradually toward its objective of 2 percent as mentioned in the excerpt and no important information has occurred or transpired. Inflation moved toward a 2 percent target, but idiosyncratic things holding down measured inflation have dropped out."

Make a prediction based on the following excerpt:
Since March, the Committee has stated that it would raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it had seen further improvement in the labor market and was reasonably confident that inflation would move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term. The labor market has clearly shown significant further improvement toward our objective of maximum employment. The unemployment rate, at 5 percent in November, is down 0.6 percentage point from the end of last year and is close to the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of its longer-run normal level.

Overall consumer price inflation—as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures—was only ¼ percent over the 12 months ending in October. However, much of the shortfall from our 2 percent objective reflected the sharp declines in energy prices since the middle of last year, and the effects of these declines should dissipate over time.
[/INST]
### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","that, given that we know there were significant reductions in energy prices since mid-2019, as the Committee states, those effects should diminish with time and labor market conditions should continue to show improvement, resulting to a likely NO_CHANGE in stock price. As we know from the given excerpt, consumer price inflation has been quite low—only ¼ percent over a period of 12 months ending October. The fact that the Committee anticipates ongoing economic growth and additional improvement in labor market conditions will most probably bolster expectations for higher prices in future periods, thereby, resulting to NO_CHANGE, since there is no expectation for a change in stock price.

### MINOR_DECREASE could be a different prediction because the given excerpt also states “shortfall from our 2 percent objective” and it’s possible, some analysts could be disappointed that inflation has not been meeting its target of 2 percent objective over medium term. But there is a high level of NO_CHANGE, so we would need further excerpts and the meaning of additional improvement to change stock price, as the given excerpt does indicate expectation for improvement in labor market condition.","Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: NO_CHANGE."

### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","[INST: yes, go ahead] based on the meaning of the given excerpt and the following points:
- The median unemployment rate is slightly lower than in September, indication lesser number of people losing jobs. A lesser number of people losing jobs means higher stock price as more people will be gainfully employed resulting to increased demand for goods and services.
- Some participants edged down their estimates, suggesting a general improvement in labor market condition, leading to the expectation that stock price would increase over time.
[INST: yes, go ahead]
- Participants project inflation to be very low this year. Inflation is often considered bad as it increases the prices of goods and services and decrease the buying power of money, resulting in lower stock price, thus the participants’ expectation that the inflation projection remains low, may be indicative of the stock price increasing over time.
[INST: yes, go ahead]
- Participants project inflation to increase slightly in coming years, this could be an indication that the stock price is expected to continue to increase as well, given an improving labor market condition and low, although slightly increasing, inflation projection.

Make a prediction based on the following excerpt:
Specifically, the Board of Governors raised the interest rate paid on required and excess reserves to ½ percent, and the FOMC authorized overnight reverse repurchase operations at an offering rate of ¼ percent. We decided to move at this time because we feel the conditions that we set out for a move—namely, further improvement in the labor market and reasonable confidence that inflation would move back to 2 percent over the medium term—we felt that these conditions had been satisfied. And while there is a drag from net exports, from relatively weak growth abroad, and the appreciation of the dollar, overall, we decided today that the risks to the outlook for the labor market and the economy are balanced.

### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
",the change in stock price could be categorized as: NO_CHANGE.,"Based on the given excerpt spoken by an important figure in finance. We can make the following interpretations: Firstly, incoming information might call into December 16, 2015 question. This implies there are indicators that could be categorized as evidence suggesting that the Committee should think twice about their initial expectation or inflation forecast. The Committee is anticipating a median expectation for the following year that runs about 1.6 percent of the year, including both core and headline inflation.

Based on the given excerpt, we understand that: Firstly, incoming information could be categorized as evidence suggesting that the Committee should think twice about their initial expectation or the inflation forecast. Inflation is projected to run about 1.6 percent over the next year; both core and headline.

The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","Based on the given excerpt, the Committee expects low levels of Inflation, as median expectation states that it runs at about 1.6 percent for the following year and this has nothing to do with oil prices rebound, meaning, there won't be much impact on inflation price from oil prices as they won't be rising to higher levels.

Make a prediction based on the following excerpt:
So, when you say that central banks often kill them, I think the usual reason that that has been true when that has been true is that central banks have begun too late to tighten policy, and they’ve allowed inflation to get out of control. And at that point, they have had to tighten policy very abruptly and very substantially, and it’s caused a downturn, and the downturn has served to lower inflation. So, in thinking about their labor market prospects and their financial prospects going forward, I hope they will take this decision as one that signals the FOMC’s confidence that conditions will continue to strengthen and job market prospects will be good.

### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","Based on the given excerpt, we can understand several points about what the important figure in finance is expressing: Firstly, they note that policy tightening has been abrupt and substantial. This likely means that interest rates have risen and economic growth has slowed or possibly even reversed in response to these higher borrowing costs. We know this is a factor affecting stock price performance.
Furthermore, we also see the FOMC’s confidence that conditions will continue strengthening—in the labor market and other financial prospects of their country.

Inflation projections are low, and real GDP growth is moderate, suggesting a healthy but not overheated economy—a setting well-suited for a stable or slightly increasing stock market.
However, the median inflation projection is 1.7 percent this year, and since stock price increases may be diminished by too-high inflation.

This may lead to additional job creation, boosting consumer confidence, spending, and ultimately driving up stock price.
Furthermore, stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE, NO_CHANGE, MAJOR_INCREASE, MINOR_DECREASE, MINOR_DECREASE.","the change in stock price could be categorized as: MAJOR_DECREASE.
Based on the given excerpt, there are a few points that support this categorization: MINOR_DECREASE. The median projection for the unemployment rate stands at MINOR_INCREASE. Compared with the projections made in September, real GDP growth is a little stronger. There could be the expectation that as the unemployment rate slightly increases and runs close to its longer-run normal rate, businesses could reduce their workforce. And, there could be an expectation that the inflation projection is MINOR_DECREASE. Compared with September’s projections, the median inflation projection remains essentially unchanged, which could mean there will be little change in stock price.

This means that there can be supply effects. Mentions that participants recognize the unemployment rate, which is lower than their estimates of the long-run sustainable Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL rate and the economy in vicinity of full employment, meaning that the demand side could be stronger, resulting to stock price increasing as more supply can support faster GDP without a need for policy to control it.

The economy has had low productivity growth that could be support faster GDP, without creating a need to tighten monetary policy.

Well, okay, growth is a little stronger, the unemployment rate runs a little bit lower—that would perhaps push in the direction of slightly tighter monetary policy. But, again, counterbalancing that is that inflation has run lower than we expect, and, you know, it could take a longer period of a very strong labor market in order to achieve the inflation objective. In supervision, in the payment system—he’s played an active role there—and in monetary policy, and I have confidence that he is very capable of steering the Federal Reserve in the years ahead.

So, undoubtedly, there are individuals who could lose a lot of money if December 13, 2017 bitcoin were to fall in price, but I really don’t see that as creating a full-blown financial Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL stability risk. And one reason for that is that long-term interest rates generally embody two factors. One is the expected average value of short rates over, say, 10 years, and the second piece of it is a so-called term premium that often reflects things like inflation—inflation risk.

There could be individuals who could lose money in case of a December 13, bitcoin price drop, but generally, there will not be a full-blown stability risk for the financial Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL. Factors that affect long-term interest rates are the expected average value of short rates over 10 years. And the second piece is often reflected in inflation risks, or so-called term premiums.

That the unemployment rate has been near the record low.
And,
Inflation is at a stable rate and also low.
With respect to stock price, the given excerpt and the mentioned factors could be categorized into two: MAJOR_DECREASE, MINOR_DECREASE, NO_CHANGE, MINOR_INCREASE, MAJOR_INCREASE.
However, with the given excerpt, we could predict a NO_CHANGE in stock price, as there are no indications that could support an increase in stock price and equally, not indications to support the decrease, given the fact of low inflation rates and near record-low unemployment rate.","Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE, NO_CHANGE."

","Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE.","that the stock price could MAJOR_DECREASE, given an excerpt spoken by an important figure in finance. There are several reasons for this expectation:
1. Projections of growth have been marked down: The additional tightening of financial conditions over the past couple of months and signs of somewhat weaker growth abroad could signal slower expansion, leading FOMC participants to mark lower growth and inflation projections.
2. Decreased confidence in the median projection: With the median of FOMC participants projecting growth of 3 percent this year and 2.3 percent in 2019, the downward adjustment suggests lessened certainty among FOMC members about the trajectory of economic growth.
3. Indication of moderation: Mentions of moderating growth suggest that FOMC participants foresee a gradual reduction in pace but not a sharp decline, signaling that the change could be categorized as MAJOR_INCREASE.
4. Caution in forecasting: As FOMC members note that conditions have changed, they appear to exercise more care while predicting growth and inflation projections. Indicating an expectation for moderate growth but noting its uncertainty could foretell a stock price decline.

Make a prediction based on the following excerpt:
The additional tightening of financial conditions we have seen over the past couple of months along with signs of somewhat weaker growth abroad have also led us to mark down growth and inflation projections a bit. The median of FOMC participants’ projections shows growth of 3 percent this year and 2.3 percent in 2019. With growth remaining next year above its longer-run normal value, the unemployment rate is projected to fall a bit further, to 3.5 percent by the end of 2019.
[/INST]
### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE. The change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_INCREASE.","Based on the given excerpt, we can understand that there would be: NO_CHANGE, MINOR_DECREASE, MAJOR_DECREASE, MINOR_DECREASE. We know this because the given excerpt states that financial conditions have tightened a little more in the past few months, and growth abroad is weakening slightly; as a result, the FOMC participants lowered their projections for growth. As shown in the given excerpt, the unemployment rate projections have not changed, so stock price growth remains the same as well."

### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","Based on the given excerpt, participants of FOMC have projected the growth rate to be 3 percent in this year and 2.3 percent next year, which indicates a healthy and stable growth rate, the unemployment rate projections near to 3.5 percent indicate healthy job market conditions with less people out of jobs and the median projection near inflation rate remains around the longer run normal value that is 2 percent.
Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE, which translates to NO_CHANGE,","the given excerpt emphasizes that FOMC participants project growth remaining next year above its longer-run normal value, unemployment rates falling to below their longer-run normal levels and the median projection for the federal funds rate in 2019 remains near 2 percent. These projections could signal the overall strength of the economy, resulting in an increase in stock price as the meaning of the excerpt is one that would generally give market optimism, thereby predicting MAJOR_INCREASE.

So this review, what it really is—it’s coming at a time when the economy is strong, and it’s a good time to take a step back, we think, and ask whether our strategy and our tools and our communications around monetary policy are doing the job that Congress has assigned us to do on behalf of the American people. We may be in a world where interest rates are just lower for the time being, and, therefore, we’ll have less policy space to react to economic downturns. We’re not looking at law changes at all, and we’re not looking at changing the inflation target, for example.

### Reasoning

As we analyze the given excerpt on conditions in the labor market, job gains have been consistent for three months, averaging about 750,000 per month, a significant figure in economic activity that understates shortfall in employment.

The median inflation projection from Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL FOMC participants falls from 4.2 percent this year to 2.2 percent next year. As the reopening continues, bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other constraints could again prove to be greater and longer lasting than anticipated, posing upside risks to inflation. Our framework for monetary policy emphasizes the importance of having well-anchored inflation expectations, both to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to promote our broad-based and inclusive maximum-employment goal.
[/INST]
### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE.","the change in stock price could be categorized as MAJOR_DECREASE. Firstly, the median inflation projection given by Powell states that the percentage that falls from 4 percent to 2 percent could imply a change in stock price could be categorized as MAJOR_DECREASE. In addition, the fact that bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other constraints could prove greater and more prolonged than anticipated poses upside risks for inflation, meaning there will be an increase, which is a risk factor to stock price as it may likely decrease."

","Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE.","Based on the given excerpt, there are several indicators suggesting: MINOR_DECREASE in stock price. First, total PCE and core inflation pressures have been muted over the past 12 months, meaning there is little upward pressure on prices. Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have decline, resulting at the lower end of their historic ranges, a further indication that the current rate of price increases are not likely to increase significantly.
Moreover, the use of the term, MINOR_DECREASE and the downward slide in long-term inflation expectation are also suggestive of stock price could see some decline in the near future. The fact that the change in stock price could be categorized as NO_CHANGE but given the above indicators suggest a more categorized categorization as MINOR_DECREASE, with stock price slightly sliding down, MAJOR_DECREASE could be categorized out since there is no obvious MAJOR_INCREASE categorization.
So based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE, with stock price slightly sliding down."

Inflation pressures remain muted, and indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are at the lower end of their historic ranges.

Make a prediction based on the following excerpt:
As always, we base our decisions on our judgment of how best to achieve the goals Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability. We believe monetary policy is well positioned to serve the American people by supporting continued economic growth, a strong job market, and a return of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent goal. Growth in household spending moderated toward the end of last year, but with a healthy job market, rising incomes, and upbeat consumer confidence, the fundamentals supporting household spending are solid.

### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE. The change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE.
This judgment is based on the following aspects:
Inflation and resource utilization: There may be some downward pressure on stock prices if, as the change indicates, global disinflationary tendencies are ongoing and persistent and low levels of sensitivity of inflation to resource utilization imply that interest rates have declined. As a result of this new normal, the neutral actual interest rate has fallen considerably and around the world. Lower-than-target unemployment has resulted in more accommodative monetary policy, which may reduce stock price growth.
Conversely, central banks, like other central banks, struggle with inflation goals. These difficulties could raise uncertainty about the effectiveness of monetary policy and lower stock price projections.
But the change in stock price can be categorized as: NO_CHANGE.","Based on the given excerpt, we see that the important figure in finance is discussing global disinflationary tendencies. Inflation, or a decline thereof, is one of the essential things that can affect stock prices. Lower inflation often means less need for interest rate increases and more accommodative monetary policy, which could support stock price increases.
The figure in finance also says that central banks have had difficulty reaching their goals, especially when it comes to meeting inflation objectives. As stock price movements are also based on how effectively central banks meet those objectives, the change in stock price could be categorized as MAJOR_INCREASE."

It emphasizes that lower and stable inflation can lead to long-term expectations of inflation drifting down and pulling actual inflation even further below. As a result, the effective lower bound for interest rates is closer.
These factors could signal that stock price could be categorized as: MAJOR_DECREASE."

Some of the factors weighing on growth were expected. For example, exports have been soft, reflecting subdued foreign demand and the earlier appreciation of the dollar. Also, activity in the energy sector has obviously been hard hit by the steep drop in oil prices since mid-2014.

### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","Based on the given excerpt, we know that exports have been soft reflecting subdued foreign demand, and activity in energy sector has been hard hit by the steep drop in oil prices, the factors weighing on growth were expected. All of those factors are pointing toward NO_CHANGE stock price, since there is no unexpectedly positive news to counterbalance the negative effects.

Therefore, based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE","Based on the given excerpt, there are signs that could indicate an adverse effect on the country's exportation. The fact that export has been soft reflect subdued foreign demand and earlier dollar appreciation. In addition to this, activity in energy sectors would obviously be hard hit by oil prices drop since mid-2014, given the importance of the energy sector in determining inflation, exchange rates, and overall economic outlook of a nation.
Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MAJOR_DECREASE."

### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE.","Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: NO_CHANGE. The given excerpt does not point toward any substantial growth or decline in exports, activity in the energy sector, and household spending. Most of the points raised are consistent with an economy that is progressing, albeit at a reduced pace. For example, the earlier dollar appreciation has adversely affected export development but not to the level where a MAJOR_DECREASE could be envisioned. Likewise, growth in household spending might have slowed somewhat early in the year, yet this does not signal a substantial downward movement for stock price. Overall, given the given excerpt, there appear to be little reasons for a MINOR_DECREASE. As there is little indication of upward development, a NO_CHANGE is a fair expectation based on the given excerpt.

Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MAJOR_INCREASE."

On the one hand, we have less unemployment, as shown by a fall in May from 5 percent to 4.7 percent, which appears to be an improvement that could signal the beginning of economic growth and expansion, resulting in stock price increases.
On the other hand, when there are more people actively seeking work than before, and fewer are reportedly doing so; this could point to underlying weaknesses in job creation. A broader measure of unemployment that includes individuals who want and are available but have not searched recently as well as people working part-time but would rather work full time has flattened out, further suggesting that we shouldn’t read too much into a simple fall in the headline unemployment rate without taking other indicators into account.

","Based on the given excerpt, we see that overall consumer price inflation remains below their objective of 2 percent. We also know from our given excerpt core inflation has run close to 1½ percent.

However, we know that energy prices have had earlier declines and import prices are lower, thus leading to lower overall consumer price inflation; the effects of the earlier decline in energy price may still be predominantly reflected in current price levels, and so we shouldn't expect a significant change in stock price.

The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","Based on the given excerpt spoken by an important figure in finance that productivity growth could stay low for an extended time, which is depressing neutral rates. Factors related to slow productivity growth are not likely to rapidly disappear and could be part of the new normal. Slow productivity growth, aging societies, and uncertainty about productivity growth could lead to downward shifts in assessments over time. As these factors persist, stock price could be correlated with the given excerpt.
Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE.","Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MAJOR_INCREASE.
Based on the given excerpt, we understand that the neutral rate will remain low for an extended time and may stay at a persistently lower level because of slow productivity growth. As aging societies worldwide have depressed this neutral rate, it appears unlikely to rapidly disappear.
As productivity growth could stay below for an extended period, businesses are likely to make long-term plans, anticipating low interest rates, and investment. The given excerpt emphasizes a downward shift in assessments over time and lowering neutral rates. As the assessment continues to be marked lower, this indicates that the change in stock price could be categorized as: MAJOR_INCREASE.

Make a prediction based on the following excerpt:
So we do monitor indicators of inflation expectations carefully. Now, it’s very hard to know exactly what inflation expectations are relevant to actual price and wage decisions. And so, for example, we have seen the Michigan survey, a measure of household inflation expectations, move down.

### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","Based on the given excerpt, an important figure in finance states that they monitor indicators of inflation expectation carefully and provide an example with a change in Michigan survey, which measures household inflation expectations, down. Indicators of inflation expectation show downward pressure on stock price when actual price, and wage decisions are in view. Inflation expectation in the economy may have a bearing on stock price as well, and a decline in such indicators would be a bad signal for the stock price that is correlated with the piece of text, leading me to predict: MINOR_DECREASE.","Based on the given excerpt, an important figure in finance has indicated that they carefully monitor indicators of inflation expectations. And it’s hard to know exactly what inflation expectations are relevant to actual price and wage decisions. Further, we see that the Michigan survey measures household inflation expectations move down. This change in stock price could be categorized as: NO_CHANGE."

It creates channels through which domestic demand is depressed. At the moment, net exports—well, for quite some time and probably going forward, they will be somewhat of a drag on U.S. growth, so that’s a factor that we take into account.

The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_INCREASE.","Based on the given excerpt, the path of median inflation projections has slightly diminished. Further, heightened concerns about growth in China and other emerging market economies have led to notable volatility in the financial markets and widened overall risk spreads since their July meeting—including dropping equity prices, further appreciating dollar and a widening in risk spreads. These developments since their July meeting have tightened overall financial conditions to some extent.
Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE, as developments have tightened overall financial conditions slightly and heightened concerns about growth abroad could imply that economic activity might be slower than earlier anticipated and lower inflation projections could mean the central bank will take less accommodative measures."

There are a number of reasons why the change could be categorized as NO_CHANGE. Firstly, the excerpt emphasizes that the current level of housing starts is below what appears consistent with underlying demographics in an economy that creates jobs, and this could mean that the stock price will not see significant growth or decline. Also, although income growth and job market improvement could support demand for housing, the change could be categorized as NO_CHANGE because there is no expectation that interest rates will increase abruptly over time. Moreover, the complex effect through balance sheets, liabilities, and assets means that the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE, but given the emphasis on a gradual path of short-term interest rates, NO_CHANGE appears more appropriate.","Based on the given excerpt, important figure in finance is talking about housing starts, job market, income growth, short-term interest rates, and asset prices.

Make a prediction based on the following excerpt:
It is true that interest rates affect asset prices, but they have a complex effect through balance sheets, through liabilities and assets. To me, the main thing that an accommodative monetary policy does is put people back to work. And since income inequality is surely exacerbated by a high—having high unemployment and a weak job market that has the most profound negative effects on the most vulnerable individuals, to me, putting people back to work and seeing a strengthening of the labor market that has a disproportionately favorable effect on vulnerable portions of our population, that’s not something that increases income inequality.
[/INST]
### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","the change in stock price could be categorized as MAJOR_DECREASE. These are the following reasons:
1. Interest rate has a complex effect through balance sheets, through liabilities, and assets: As the interest rates affect the balance sheet of the companies, any change in interest rates can be disruptive to their assets, liabilities, and overall financial health. Moreover, it has a complex effect; thus, any accommodative monetary policy may be partially offset by other factors or aspects that could be detrimental to stock price.
2. Inflation: An accommodative monetary policy intended to put people back to work could raise the employment level and strengthen the labor market. With the awe-inspiring job market, it might diminish income inequality. Nevertheless, as the policy is accommodative, it can increase stock price in the near term, as high unemployment weakens the labor market.
However, given that the change in stock price could be categorized as MAJOR_DECREASE.","Based on the given excerpt spoken by an important figure in finance. The change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE, NO_CHANGE."

1. Economic activity: Even though we haven’t altered the pace of interest rate growth, they continue to support economic activity, which is evident from a rise in long- and short-term rates. As the economy will keep getting support, this should encourage further spending and investment decisions in various sectors that are correlated with the stock price.
2. FOMC participants: Indicators that show appropriate monetary policy evolving are individual FOMC participants writing down their individual views. Growth in appropriate measures will support a rising stock price.
3. Economic liftoff: Since interest rates have been pushing economic activity, the economy should be expanding, leading to increased stock price performance.
4. Statement assurance: As shown in the statement, providing assurance that we weren’t trying to slow down economic activity can lead to a rising stock price, given an excerpt spoken by an important figure in finance."

### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE.","Based on the given excerpt, we understand that an important figure in finance states that there could be a slowdown in job growth or unexpectedly sharp increases in inflation and wages as indicators of reaching specific points. Looking closer, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MAJOR_INCREASE.
These factors would be expected to increase, resulting in a significant surge in stock price if we see signs that the job market or economy may be reaching saturation points. These indicators suggest conditions in the labor sector have tightened, and companies raise wages and prices to keep pace with rising inflation.
The change in stock price could be categorized as: NO_CHANGE. These factors would be expected to stay the same, resulting in a stable stock price if we see signs that conditions in the labor sector have been consistent, or changes in stock price are not categorized by the given excerpt and do not meet the threshold for MAJOR_DECREASE, MINOR_INCREASE.
Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized: MINOR_DECREASE. These factors would be expected to stay somewhat consistent with a slightly downward trend, resulting in a small reduction in stock price if we see signs that job growth is slowing down and wages are not increasing unexpectedly, but conditions have still not reached significant saturation points where companies could raise prices.
Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could categorized: MAJOR_DECREASE. These factors would be expected to significantly worsen, resulting in a considerable drop in stock price, we see signs that job growth is substantially slowing down, unexpectedly sharp increases in inflation, and prices are not sustaining at current levels.
The change in stock price could categorized: NO_CHANGE."

### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","Based on the given excerpt, important figure in finance expects inflation to return to 2 percent and also monetary policy will be done to control it, which could mean a gradual reduction in oil price-led temporary increase in headline inflation. Oil prices would, as a result of this development, most likely reduce.

As the temporary increase in headline inflation could be a function of oil prices, this person seems to down play it. They also emphasize monetary policy influence over inflation.
At nearly full employment, this figure likely wants the inflation rate to stabilize around current levels and not overshoot. It is likely that they expect to maintain policies that control inflation in a range near current rates rather than significantly raise or lower the federal funds rate.

### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE.
Monetary policy is an important indicator of economic activity. The excerpt emphasizes that interest rates are low, suggesting the possibility of a gradual reduction in those interest rates. Lowering interest rates has the potential to encourage economic activity and spending, resulting in inflation. However, if we anticipate lowering interest rates to support economic activity while we near or maintain maximum employment levels, stock price increases are less likely. As stock prices have risen as a result of historically low-interest rates, we may be closer to maximum employment. In contrast, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE, given the given excerpt, because, if interest rates are already at very low levels, their potential lowering may have little impact on inflation or market activity. As a result, a minor downward stock price adjustment is expected to occur.","Based on the given excerpt, important figure in finance is referring to the current state of the economy: a neighborhood or near-fulled employment. The interest rates are low, meaning monetary policy can support economic activity without stoking price increases. They also mentioned low unemployment, which could increase demand and spending, further supporting the economy.

After precipitous drops in March and April, employment rose strongly in May and June as many people returned to work from temporary layoffs.
[/INST]
### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE.","that given the recovery of economic activity mentioned in the excerpt, stock price could MAJOR_DECREASE. There are a few factors at the following:
First, employment rose strongly toward the end of the period spoken of in the excerpt; with the economy beginning to reopen, the need to maintain an expanded unemployment benefit and federal stimulus payments is diminished. Following that, with many returning from temporary layoffs and employment increasing as mentioned in the excerpt, this might mean there would be a lesser need for expanded support payments to household income.
Another factor could be the wording of the excerpt: the change in stock price can be categorized as MAJOR_DECREASE given that the economy only just began reopening and it has only been strong toward the end of the period spoken about, meaning there may have not been enough time for the effects of expanded unemployment payments and stimulus on employment to fully materialize.

Returning to monetary policy, the recent pickup in economic growth and continued progress in the labor market have strengthened the case for an increase in the federal funds rate. And while inflation remains low, we expect it to rise to our 2 percent objective over time. But with labor market slack being taken up at a somewhat slower pace than in previous years, scope for some further improvement in the labor market remaining, and inflation continuing to run below our 2 percent target, we chose to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward our objectives.

Make a prediction based on the following excerpt:
We are trying to decide what the best policy is to foster price stability and maximum employment and to manage the variety of risks that we see as affecting the outlook. Well, I think if you saw us revising up our growth forecasts, revising down our estimates, well, with an unchanged path for policy, you know, if you saw this, you would see revisions in the funds rate path. But if unemployment were moving down faster than we had anticipated, if we saw faster growth or upward pressure on inflation, that would be suggestive of the appropriateness of reevaluating whether or not the neutral funds rate had increased.

### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","Based on the given excerpt, important figure in finance states that: the neutral rate of interest appears to be low, policies have been accommodative, and inflation and employment objectives are being achieved. These factors suggest a supportive environment for stock prices. However, the excerpt does mention high price-to-rent ratios in commercial real estate and low cap rates, which could be signs of asset valuations being out of line with historical norms, particularly in that particular sector.

Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: NO_CHANGE,","the change in stock price could be categorized as MAJOR_DECREASE based on the following points: MINOR_DECREASE. Let me explain why: MINOR_DECREASE.

1. **HIGHLY_ACCOMMODATIVE_POLICIES:** The change in stock price could categorized as MINOR_DECREASE based on the fact that highly accommodative policies are consistent with low-interest rates, and historically have led to lower asset valuations over time. Asset prices may slightly decrease as investors rebalance their portfolios in light of more accommodative policies from central banks, which could depress certain sectors like commercial real estate. MINOR_DECREASE.
1. **Asset_VALUATION:** MINOR_INCREASE. In general, the change in stock price could categorized as MINOR_DECREASE. Asset valuations are not out of line with historical norms; however, there are areas my colleague President Rosengren focused on: commercial real estate, where price-to-rent ratios are very high or cap rates are low. This could be categorized as MINOR_DECREASE.
1. **Commercial Real Estate:** MINOR_INCREASE. Price-to-rent ratios are very high in commercial real estate. Asset prices may slightly decrease, particularly if interest rates were to rise in light of more accommodative central bank policy. MINOR_INCREASE."

Beyond these effects, we are also likely to see upward pressure on prices from the rebound in spending as the economy continues to reopen, particularly if supply bottlenecks limit how quickly production can respond in the near term. However, these one-time increases in prices are likely to have only transitory effects on inflation.

### Reasoning
The reasoning behind my prediction is 
","the change in stock price could be categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE, below are the reasons:
1. The change in stock price could be categorized as NO_CHANGE, given that the unemployment level in the excerpt given remains somewhat elevated for an extended period of time as mentioned in the excerpt, which may be suggestive of a neutral stance in stock price.
2. And also, the change could categorized as: MINOR_DECREASE, given the fact that although there might be strong demand for housing as mentioned in the excerpt, the supply remains low.","Based on the given excerpt, the change in stock price could be categorized as: MAJOR_DECREASE.
Let me explain the following reasons why I came up with this categorization.
Based on the given excerpt, the important figure in finance states that:
1. Unemployment levels haven’t risen to highly elevated levels.
2. There are a lot of people who are out of work.
This indicates that, although unemployment levels have not been drastically affected, the number of individuals without jobs remains substantial, negatively affecting stock price increases, resulting in MAJOR_DECREASE."
