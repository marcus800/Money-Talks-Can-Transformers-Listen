Readings on inflation have increased and are likely to rise somewhat further before moderating.,MINOR_INCREASE,0.009000000000924
"In the near term, 12-month measures of PCE inflation are expected to move above 2 percent as the very low readings from early in the pandemic fall out of the calculation and past increases in oil prices pass through to consumer energy prices.",MINOR_INCREASE,0.3570000000008804
"Beyond these effects, we are also likely to see upward pressure on prices from the rebound in spending as the economy continues to reopen, particularly if supply bottlenecks limit how quickly production can respond in the near term.",MINOR_DECREASE,-0.0119999999997162
"However, these one-time increases in prices are likely to have only transitory effects on inflation.",MINOR_DECREASE,-0.3480000000008658

"As we say in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal.",MINOR_INCREASE,0.1999999999998181
Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent.,MINOR_DECREASE,-0.0090000000000145
"As the Committee reiterated in today’s policy statement, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.",MINOR_INCREASE,0.6399999999994179

I would note that a transitory rise in inflation above 2 percent this year would not meet this standard.,MINOR_INCREASE,0.9879999999993744

"So it seems unlikely, frankly, that we would see inflation moving up in a persistent way that would actually move inflation expectations up while there was still significant slack in the labor market.",MINOR_INCREASE,0.3059999999995852
It’s much more likely that we would—having achieved maximum-employment conditions—we’d also be seeing 2 percent inflation and be on track to see inflation moving above 2 percent.,MINOR_DECREASE,-0.4549999999999272
"So that’s not to say inflation won’t—might not move up, but for inflation to move up in a persistent way that, that really starts to move inflation expectations up, that would have to—that would take some time.",MINOR_INCREASE,0.2060000000001309
"If it—if that actually were to happen, though, there is a—there’s a paragraph in the—in the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy which says that when the two goals are somewhat in conflict, we weigh various factors, including the, the time it would take to get back and [so] forth.",MINOR_INCREASE,0.2399999999997817
"We’re, we’re really focused on the economic outcomes, and, again, my, my guess is that we—it’s very likely, it seems to me, that for us to achieve the economic outcomes, we would need to taper or to raise interest rates.",MAJOR_INCREASE,1.7969999999995707
"Notwithstanding that, we’re a long way from full employment.",NO_CHANGE,0.0

"There’s no question, though, that housing prices are going up, and so we’re watching that carefully.",MINOR_INCREASE,1.3060000000004948
"It’s, it’s partly because there’s, there’s clearly strong demand, and there’s just not a lot of supply right now.",MINOR_DECREASE,-0.1549999999997453
"So builders are, you know, struggling to keep up with the demand, clearly.",MINOR_DECREASE,-0.2150000000001455
"And, you know, my hope would be that, over time, housing builders can react to this demand and, and come up with more supply and workers will come back to work in that industry.",MINOR_DECREASE,-0.5120000000006257
"So, you know, it is—it’s not an unalloyed good to have prices going up this much, and we’re watching it very carefully.",MAJOR_DECREASE,-3.006000000000313
We don’t see bad loans and unsustainable prices and that kind of thing.,MINOR_DECREASE,-0.2030000000004292

"But I do think that—and I do think also that unemployment insurance benefits will run out in September, so to the extent that’s a factor, which is not clear, it will no longer be a factor fairly soon.",MINOR_DECREASE,-0.0060000000003128
"So my guess is, it will come back to this economy where we have, you know, equilibrium between labor supply and labor demand.",MINOR_INCREASE,1.4909999999999854
"So I actually have a couple things I’d like to say about inflation, including addressing your question.",MINOR_INCREASE,0.4849999999996726
So let me start with just saying that we’re very strongly committed to achieving our objectives of maximum employment and price stability.,MINOR_DECREASE,-0.293999999999869
"Our, our price stability goal is 2 percent inflation over the longer run, and we believe that having inflation average 2 percent over time will help anchor long-term inflation expectations at 2 percent.",MINOR_DECREASE,-0.0090000000000145
"With inflation having run persistently below 2 percent for some time, the Committee seeks inflation moderately above inflation for two times—above 2 percent for some time.",MINOR_DECREASE,-0.1880000000001018
"In the United States, fiscal and monetary policy continue to provide strong support: Vaccinations are now widespread, and the economy is beginning to move ahead with real momentum.",MINOR_INCREASE,0.0120000000006257
"During this time of reopening, we are likely to see some upward pressure on prices, and I’ll discuss why.",MINOR_INCREASE,0.0150000000003274
"In an episode of one-time price increases as the economy reopens is not the same thing as, and is not likely to lead to, persistently higher year-over-year inflation into the future—inflation at levels that are not consistent with our goal of 2 percent inflation over time.",MINOR_DECREASE,-0.293999999999869
"If, if, contrary to expectations, inflation were to move persistently and materially above 2 percent in a manner that threatened to move longer-term inflation expectations materially above 2 percent, we would use our tools to bring inflation and expectations down to mandate-consistent levels.",MINOR_DECREASE,-0.0630000000001018
And we know that our job is to achieve 2 percent inflation over time.,MINOR_DECREASE,-0.0480000000006839
"So let me talk quickly about the two reasons—two, or you could say three, but really two main reasons why we think inflation will move up in the near term.",MINOR_DECREASE,-0.2969999999995707
Twelve-month measures of inflation are likely to move well above 2 percent over the next few months as the very low inflation readings recorded in March and April of last year drop out of the calculation.,MINOR_DECREASE,-0.4969999999993888
"You saw it in the March CPI reading, and you’ll see it later this week in the PCE price data.",MINOR_DECREASE,-0.2029999999995198
These base effects will contribute about 1 percentage point to headline inflation and about 0.7 percentage point to core inflation in April and May.,MINOR_DECREASE,-0.1939999999995052
They carry no implication for the rate of inflation in later periods.,MINOR_DECREASE,-0.5510000000003856

"Inflation expectations actually went down a bit at the beginning of the pandemic, and now they’ve just moved back up to levels broadly—that, that are where they were in 2018, or in some cases 2014, and, I would say, more consistent with our mandate.",MINOR_INCREASE,0.451999999999316
We want inflation to run a little bit higher than it has been running for the last quarter of a century.,MAJOR_DECREASE,-2.706000000000131

"As, as you know, at the very beginning of the financial—of the—of this recent crisis, there was such a demand for selling Treasuries, including by foreign central banks, that, really, the dealers couldn’t handle the volume.",MAJOR_INCREASE,2.0150000000003274

Last month we quickly lowered our policy interest rate to near zero.,MINOR_INCREASE,0.1970000000001164

So I don’t know that the demand will be quite as strong as—as it has been for the PPP.,MAJOR_INCREASE,2.443000000000211

Today the FOMC also updated its forward guidance regarding the path of short-term interest rates.,MINOR_DECREASE,-0.0030000000001564
"In December 2012, the Committee first stated its guidance in terms of economic thresholds, stipulating that the current low range for the federal funds rate target would be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above our longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.",MINOR_INCREASE,0.7820000000001528

"Although the thresholds served well as a useful guide to policy over the past year, last December the FOMC judged it appropriate to update that guidance, noting that the current target range for the federal funds rate would likely be maintained “well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal.” Today the Committee has further revised its forward guidance to better reflect conditions as they now stand and are likely to evolve over coming quarters.",MINOR_DECREASE,-0.2390000000000327

"In particular, the Committee states that “[i]n determining how long to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate, it [the Committee] will assess progress—both realized and expected—toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.” In short, the larger the shortfall of employment or inflation from the respective objectives set by the FOMC, and the longer any such shortfall is expected to persist, the longer the target federal funds rate is likely to remain in the present 0 to ¼ percent range.",MINOR_DECREASE,-0.4960000000000946

"The Committee continues to anticipate that conditions will likely warrant maintaining “the current range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.” The FOMC also supplemented its guidance pertaining to the period after the asset purchase program ends and the initial increase in the federal funds rate target has occurred.",MINOR_INCREASE,1.0529999999998836
"The statement now adds the Committee’s current anticipation that “even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping” short-term interest rates “below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.” This guidance is consistent with the paths for appropriate policy as reported in the participants’ projections, which show the federal funds rate for most participants remaining well below longer-run normal values at the end of 2016.",MINOR_DECREASE,-0.32100000000014
"Although FOMC participants provide a number of explanations for the federal funds rate target remaining below its longer-run normal level, many cite the residual impacts of the financial crisis, and some note that the potential growth rate of the economy may be lower, at least for a time.",MAJOR_DECREASE,-1.2799999999999727

Let me again emphasize that the specific timing of the initial increase in the target range for the federal funds rate is far less important for the economy than the entire expected path of interest rates.,MINOR_INCREASE,0.58400000000006
The median projected rate in 2017 remains below the rate that most participants expect to prevail in the longer run despite the fact that the median projection has the unemployment rate slightly below its longer-run normal level and inflation close to our 2 percent objective.,MINOR_INCREASE,0.0090000000000145

"If the expansion proves to be more vigorous than currently anticipated and inflation moves higher than expected, then the appropriate path would likely follow a steeper and higher trajectory.",MAJOR_INCREASE,5.18100000000004

"Now, we fully expect those further effects, like the earlier moves in the dollar and in oil prices, to be transitory.",MINOR_DECREASE,-0.0119999999999436
"But there is a little bit of downward pressure on inflation, and we would like to see some further developments.",MINOR_DECREASE,-0.2740000000001146

"As I said, although we are close to many participant’s [estimates] and the median estimate of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment, at least my own judgment—and this has been true for a long time—is that there are additional margins of slack, particularly relating to very high levels of part-time involuntary employment and labor force participation, that suggest that, at least to some extent, the standard unemployment rate understates the degree of slack in the labor market.",MAJOR_INCREASE,1.8669999999999616
"And, as I’ve said in the past, we don’t want to wait until we’ve fully met both of our objectives to begin the process of tightening policy given the lags in the operation of monetary policy.",MAJOR_DECREASE,-3.533999999999878

"We’re, after all, way below our inflation target.",MINOR_DECREASE,-0.0350000000000818
But an important reason for that is that declines in import prices reflecting the appreciation of the dollar and declines in energy prices are holding down inflation well below our target and well below core inflation.,MINOR_INCREASE,0.5529999999998836
"We expect those effects to be transitory, and with well-anchored inflation expectations, we expect inflation to move back to 2 percent.",MINOR_INCREASE,0.5139999999998963
"Now, in the intermeeting period, we have seen some further appreciation of the dollar and some further downward pressure on energy prices, and that creates a bit of further drag on inflation that I would view as transitory—is very likely to be transitory.",MINOR_DECREASE,-0.5660000000000309
"So I continue and the Committee continues to expect that inflation will move back to 2 percent, so this should be a small thing.",MINOR_DECREASE,-0.2460000000000946
"And, in the meantime, the labor market has continued to improve, so a tighter labor market, a labor market moving toward full employment, is one that historically has generated upward pressure on inflation.",MINOR_INCREASE,0.5329999999999018
So that bolsters my confidence in inflation.,MINOR_DECREASE,-0.3049999999998363

"Well, we have been very focused, Binya, on doing everything we can to revive this economy and to achieve our maximum employment objective.",MINOR_DECREASE,-0.6929999999999836

"And, I mean, when you look at the projection, you see, as you mentioned, that we see sufficient growth to push the unemployment rate.",MINOR_DECREASE,-1.3170000000000073
"We expect the unemployment rate to fall slightly—or, at least, participants project that it will fall slightly below that level.",MINOR_DECREASE,-0.3919999999998254

"Now, inflation is going back in our projection to 2 percent.",MINOR_DECREASE,-1.0879999999999654
"We have very large drags from import prices and energy prices, and over the next year or so, those things should dissipate.",MINOR_INCREASE,0.7650000000001

"Now, it’s a slow process, it’s characterized by lags, and that’s why it takes a few years as the inflation—as the unemployment rate falls and even overshoots its longer-run normal level, it just takes some time for inflation to get back to 2 percent.",MINOR_DECREASE,-0.0129999999999199
"And it’s certainly important for us, and I think our credibility hinges on defending our inflation target not only from threats that it rises above, but also that we not have—that over the medium term, that we want to see inflation get back to 2 percent.",MINOR_DECREASE,-0.9370000000001256
We want to see inflation go back to 2 percent; 2 percent is not a ceiling on inflation.,MINOR_INCREASE,1.2289999999998145
So we’re not trying to push the inflation rate above 2.,MINOR_INCREASE,0.3309999999999036
"And if it were a ceiling, you would have to be conducting a policy that, on average, would hold the inflation rate below 2 percent.",MINOR_INCREASE,0.2840000000001055
We want to see the inflation rate get back to 2 percent as rapidly as we can.,MINOR_INCREASE,0.7840000000001055
But there are lags in the impact of monetary policy on the economy.,MINOR_DECREASE,-0.2880000000000109
"And if we waited until inflation is back to 2—and that would probably mean that unemployment had declined well below our estimates of the natural rate—and only then did we start to—begin to—and, you know, the word “tighten” monetary policy I don’t think is really right because we have an immensely accommodative monetary policy in place.",MINOR_INCREASE,0.5720000000001164
"So, let me say, just to begin to diminish the extraordinary degree of accommodation for monetary policy, we would be overshoot—we would likely overshoot substantially our 2 percent objective, and we might be faced with then having to tighten policy in a way that could be disruptive to the real economy.",MAJOR_DECREASE,-1.7170000000000982
"But, at the end of the day, what we’re focused on are two things: the path for employment and whether or not we feel confident that we’re on a road that will take us to our maximum employment objective and whether or not we see the risks around obtaining that as balanced.",MINOR_DECREASE,-1.063000000000102

"In addition, we saw a very substantial downward pressure on oil prices and commodity markets, and those developments have had a significant impact on many emerging market economies that are important producers of commodities as well as more advanced countries, including Canada, which is an important trading partner of ours that has been negatively affected by declining commodity prices, declining energy prices.",MAJOR_DECREASE,-2.5039999999999054

"I think, importantly, we say in our statement that in spite of all of this, we continue to view the risks to economic activity and labor markets as balanced.",MINOR_DECREASE,-0.7019999999999982
"So, if we maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy for a very long time from here and the economy performs as we expect—namely, it’s strong and the risks that are out there don’t materialize—my concern will be that we will have much more tightening in labor markets than you see in these projections.",MINOR_INCREASE,1.0909999999998945
"And the lags will be probably slow, but eventually we will find ourselves with a substantial overshoot of our inflation objective, and then we’ll be forced into a kind of stop–go policy.",MINOR_DECREASE,-0.3740000000000236

"When we—when monetary policy tightens and interest rates rise, it commonly is the case, either when it happens or in expectation—the expectation that that’s coming—interest rate differentials globally do tend to reduce capital flows that have impacts on exchange rates.1 So monetary policy often has some effect on the exchange rate, and it’s not, in my view, the main channel by which monetary policy works.",MINOR_DECREASE,-0.3430000000000746

"Now, I recognize and it’s important that inflation has been running under our 2 percent objective for a number of years, and that is a concern, particularly if it were to translate into lower inflation expectations.",MINOR_DECREASE,-0.4690000000000509
"For a number of years there were very understandable reasons for that shortfall, and they included quite a lot of slack in the labor market—which, my judgment would be, has largely disappeared—very large reductions in energy prices, and a large appreciation of the dollar that lowered import prices starting in mid-2014.",MAJOR_INCREASE,0.7510000000002037

"So developments affecting asset prices and longer-term interest rates, the exchange rate—all of those aspects of financial conditions factor into our thinking.",MINOR_DECREASE,-0.4989999999997963

"We believe that economic conditions will evolve in a way that will warrant gradual, further increases in our federal funds rate target, but if conditions evolve differently than that, whichever direction that might be—it might be that growth is more rapid, the labor market tightens more quickly than we assume, and inflation appears to be picking up more rapidly than we had expected—we have not promised, no matter what, that the path of interest rate increases will be gradual.",MAJOR_INCREASE,1.25
